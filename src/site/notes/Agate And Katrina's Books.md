# Agate And Katrina's Books

## Sketchbook And Pen
ᶦˢ ᵗʰᵃᵗ ˢᵘᵖᵖᵒˢᵉᵈ ᵗᵒ ᵇᵉ ᵐᵉˀ
All Of The Drawings That Are Made In This Sketchbook Are Effigies Of Their Physical Counterpart. The Owner Of The Notebook Has The Ability To Make Basic Modifications (Such As Adding Small Details Like Cuts, Or Otherwise Changing The Appearance)  To The Image Which Are Reflected In Real Life. The Manipulative Capabilities Of The Sketchbook Are Limited By How Closely The Persona Matches Its Representation.

Tldr: I Draw Someone/Something And If The Drawing Is Good I Can Fuck It Up Irl
## Grimoire And Wand
ʷʰᵃᵗ ᵗʰᵉ ʰᵉˡˡ ᵃʳᵉ ʸᵒᵘˀ
When Under A Polarising Gaze (Hateful Or Loving) You Can Become Tied To This Grimoire Or Its Owner. While Bound To It A Comparative Feeling Slowly Takes Over Making It Easier For The Owner To Act On Their Emotions. The More Passionate The Feelings Become The Tighter You Are Bound.

Tldr: Strong Emotions Towards Someone Facilitates My Related Actions
