# Opening Draft
Everything's Just As Youd Expect, The Days Are Twenty Four Hours Long, The Sky's Not Full Of Smog (Whatever That Means) And The People Are Just People. I Dont Know What One Would Expect From "The Future" Or Whatever But But Theres  No Recorded Differences As Far As I Know. Thats What I Told Him. Thats What I <b>Knew</b> Until I Had Said It But Something About The Blank Expression On His Face Or The Look Of Disbelieve In His Eyes Made Me Second Guess Myself. 

There Was A Moment Of Silence As This Recently Introduced Stranger Sat On My Kitchen Floor, Partaking In More Than Their Fair Share Of Lotus Biscuits. I Usually Hate Sharing Food But Something About Him Felt Important So I Handed Off A Black, Floral Plate Of Biscuits To My Dishevelled Intruder.

He Sat Looking Outside The Window And Eventually Back At Me Before Simply Saying No. As That Calm Voice Melted Over Me I Found Myself Unable To Disagree So Instead I Just Shrugged. He Asked Why The Sky Was Indigo Which I Thought Was One Of Those Rhetorical Joke Questions "How Long Is A Piece Of String", "why Is The Sky Indigo" But No He Was Serious. So I Started Explaining How The Atmosphere Shatters Light And He Said No And Repeated The Question. Well It Turns Out That The Sky Used To Be Bright Blue Back In the Old Times. Like A Cyan Instead Of A Blueberry? All Day! Ive Just Been Informed That Its Not All Day, Its Roughly Half The Day. 

As I Was Washing The Plate That My New....Friend? Sure. As I Was Washing My Friends Plate Cal Told Me That He Also Wanted To Know Something But That They Felt Like It Would Be Rude To Ask But Since We Were Both Curious I Encouraged Him To Ask And He Did. He Asked About My Wings?
