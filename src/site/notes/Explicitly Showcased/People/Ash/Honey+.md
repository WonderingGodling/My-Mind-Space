# Honey

Heyy Honey
I Just Want You To Know That Youre Like....Gay
Is It Gay To Say I Like Gay [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]]?
Either Way Youre Pretty Cool So Whatever

Also Youre Like Pretty Cool
Sorry If I Havent Said Much Recently But I Know That Whatevers Happening Youre Either Crushing It Or Worrying About The Wrong Thing
You Worry A Lot So Distract Yourself
Go Pet The Kat

8Â·2023 He Walked In The Rain To Buy Cookie Ingredients And Because The Shop Was Closed They Went To A Different One And Bought Overpriced Chocolate
    The Incomplete Cookies Were Still Good

Got Scared By Fran Bow Starting....He Started It
If Youre Reading This: I Want You To Know That You Are So Interesting; This Is Like Three Days Of Your Strangeness And Its Already Feeling Like Gold

He Hasnt Seen Scott Pilgrim
Considering Divorce

They Just Have A Tendancy To Talk About How They Wont Talk About Something Which Means The Conversation Nets Nothing
Its....Weird
I Think Its Like Abandonment Trauma Or Something (Which Is Fair Because People Leaving Super Sucks) But I Cant Imagine Going "That Ideas Dumb! We're Not Friends Anymore" **However** He Does Need To Watch Scott Pilgrim Or I'll Riot

He Had A Very Bad Dream And As Horrified As I Am On Their Behalf I Do Have To Be Like "WTF R NITEMAREZ" Yknow?
Your Brain Goes "I Hope This Doesnt Happen" And Makes It Happen

Scopophobia 
Thats All

Theyre Upset I Dont Tell Them The Adult Thoughts I Have
Not Happening

Seriously Though Hes Very Fascinating
