I Think Corys Artificer Is Gonna Be Called "Ian Vlaim Son Of Ars" As Per My Request

"Til that Volt-amps are actually different to watts. It's mostly applicable to AC where you can have current 'sloshing' between inductors, which means that the actual amount of power used by a device (i.e watts) is different to the amount of power which travels through the cables due to the device (volt-amps)"
