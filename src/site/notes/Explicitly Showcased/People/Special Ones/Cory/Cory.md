Still Nothing From Vie So Imma Just Do That Some Other Time

Cor's In Norwich
Took A Cool Picture With A Phonebox ![](https://i.imgur.com/z89xOYt.jpeg)
Not That Cool But Phonebox
Not Comning Back Until Saturday But Is Free All Days After
Been Walking 
"Our holidays always manage to be really physically exhausting so they dont really feel like a break"
Sent Him A Video "I 3D Printed A $1,224 Chair" By Morley Kert (I Should Watch More Of Those) 
​​    ​‍Actually Was A Good Video; guy-- Why Am I Explaining It

Its Amazing That Hes Like That Yknow

Oh Yeah We Were Also Talking About

Buying Road Signs
You Can Get Custom Ones Or Just The Regular Ones And Kinda Just Put Them Wherever You Want 
Would Be Nice Honestly But Probably More Effort Than Its Worth

Currently Talking About The Boats In Norwich Canals/Rivers (norfolk broads)
"the area we were in is mostly holiday boats though, so im not sure what the fulltime houseboats would look like"
We Both Wish To Just Not Have To Exist In The Real World; Government, Taxes, People And All That 
Neither Of Us Can Figure Out How To Have Free Internet Though

"Timberborn is getting bugfixes for the experimental branch an average of more than once a day.
It's really nice seeing devs actually listen to feedback and fix + improve stuff in real time in the game...
Fun fact: The role that pings you about experimental updates in their discord is called 'Branch Taster' "

I Think Corys Artificer Is Gonna Be Called "Ian Vlaim Son Of Ars" As Per My Request

"Til that Volt-amps are actually different to watts. It's mostly applicable to AC where you can have current 'sloshing' between inductors, which means that the actual amount of power used by a device (i.e watts) is different to the amount of power which travels through the cables due to the device (volt-amps)"


##### Cory
Played Stardew Valley With Him
He Passed Out Multiple Times, Fished At One AM And Wanted To Sort Our Chests Into Green And Not Green

Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)
