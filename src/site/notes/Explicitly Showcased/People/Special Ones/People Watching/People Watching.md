Just Walked Passed A Homeless Guy With a Cat Which Is Honestly Genuis  
His Cat Was This Absolutely Adorable Little Bicolour And Of Course Nobody wants Them To Starve Or Anything So Give The Man Some Money So The Kitty Can Be [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Mechanics/Drugs/Emotion-Vial/Happy/Happy\|Happy]]!

Theres A Person In Front Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Who Has A Bright [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Mechanics/Oil Colour/Pink/pink\|pink]] Backpack And Is Standing Next To Someone Whos Jumper Is That Exact Shade Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Mechanics/Oil Colour/Pink/pink\|pink]]
It Had A Kuromi Badge!!

Two [[Branches/People\|People]] On My Train Just Shout-Sang "Naked Twister"  
They Group Theyre In Is Introducing Each Other With Their Names And How Many Drinks Theyve Had

This Shopkeeper Just Tried To Steal 20p From [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]  
I Was Buying Monster And They Were All 1.55 Except The One I Wanted And The Guy Typed Out 1.55 Into The Card Machine  
And I Wouldn't Be Upset If He Didnt Turn The Can To Check First  
100% Just Being A Dick

I Was Sitting On The Floor Trying To Listen To Shit And A Group Of Girls Started Standing Around [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] (Literally) And Had The Loudest Conversation About [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]:/


I Just Heard Someone Piss Out About A Litre Of Liquid 
Rare Case Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Using The Public Bathroom
I Go In, Pee, Leave same Guy Continuously Pissing
Hope He's [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]]


The Woman Who Lives Across The Road Just Turned The Corner (Walking Onto The Street), Lifted The Lid Of Our Bin,  Got In Her Car And Drove Away

I Dont Think Either Of Those Two Washed Their Hands

I Never Mentioned That One Guy In My Maths Lecture Whi Was Dipping His Lilipop Into His Coffee

There's A Woman At Maccies In Such A Bridesmaid Dress Its Unreal But Shes By Herself Pecking A t Fries

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

Going To Bed [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Mechanics/Drugs/Emotion-Vial/Sad/Sad\|Sad]] Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A [[Branches/Dnd\|Dnd]] Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A [[Branches/Dnd\|Dnd]] Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Moirail\|Moirail]] Doesnt Hate [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]], Id Love To See How She Talks To The [[Branches/People\|People]] He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]], Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] But Still Kinda Hates The [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Mechanics/Rest/Rest\|Rest]] Of My Existance) And A Few Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way
