Just Walked Passed A Homeless Guy With a Cat Which Is Honestly Genuis  
His Cat Was This Absolutely Adorable Little Bicolour And Of Course Nobody wants Them To Starve Or Anything So Give The Man Some Money So The Kitty Can Be Happy!

Theres A Person In Front Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Who Has A Bright Pink Backpack And Is Standing Next To Someone Whos Jumper Is That Exact Shade Of Pink
It Had A Kuromi Badge!!

Two [[Branches/People\|People]] On My Train Just Shout-Sang "Naked Twister"  
They Group Theyre In Is Introducing Each Other With Their Names And How Many Drinks Theyve Had

This Shopkeeper Just Tried To Steal 20p From [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]  
I Was Buying Monster And They Were All 1.55 Except The One I Wanted And The Guy Typed Out 1.55 Into The Card Machine  
And I Wouldn't Be Upset If He Didnt Turn The Can To Check First  
100% Just Being A Dick

I Was Sitting On The Floor Trying To Listen To Shit And A Group Of Girls Started Standing Around [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] (Literally) And Had The Loudest Conversation About [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]:/


I Just Heard Someone Piss Out About A Litre Of Liquid 
Rare Case Of Me Using The Public Bathroom
I Go In, Pee, Leave same Guy Continuously Pissing
Hope He's Okay


The Woman Who Lives Across The Road Just Turned The Corner (Walking Onto The Street), Lifted The Lid Of Our Bin,  Got In Her Car And Drove Away

I Dont Think Either Of Those Two Washed Their Hands

I Never Mentioned That One Guy In My Maths Lecture Whi Was Dipping His Lilipop Into His Coffee

There's A Woman At Maccies In Such A Bridesmaid Dress Its Unreal But Shes By Herself Pecking A t Fries
