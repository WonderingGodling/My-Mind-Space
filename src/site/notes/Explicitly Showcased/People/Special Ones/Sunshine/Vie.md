Heyyyy Cutie
How You Doing? Hope Youre Okay
If Youre Reading This And You Havent Told Me About Your Day: why Not?  Go Do  It Right Now!
More Importantly Though (Just As Importantly? (Its Had To Tell The Scale Of Importance When Both Things Involve You)) I Want You To Know I Love You <3 And Thats Pretty Cool
Youre Pretty Cool
I Dont Actually Have Anything Else To Say for Now Just I Love You ^^
Stay Happy And Healthy For Me Okay?
Youre The Best Moirail Ever So We Cant Have You Upsetty

You Should Know That You Work So Very Hard Like All The Time So Its Okay If You Need A Little Rest Every Once In A While
Take A Break
I'll Still Be Proud Of You
The Best Thing You Can Do Is Whats Best For You
Especially If Youre Sicky
Dont Be Sicky Thats Sucky
Ill Fight Yourbcold If I Have To

Also I Dont Know If Anybodys Told You This Today But You Look Pretty
Like Insanely Pretty
Hair?
Love It
Glasses?
Soooo Cotttage Core Librarian Of You
Its Just Magical That You Can Be So You All The Time Yknow

Also Just As A Reminder Im Here Like Always
So Message Me
Dont Forget To Tell Me Stuff Because Youre Allpwed To Repeat Yoursels
Any Excuse To Hear/Read You Talk Is A Good Excuse And One I Will Gladly Take Advantage Of  ^^

Also You Should Know (You Probably Already Do)
But If I Were A Demon And You Were A Demon Then Id Invite You To Possess People And Scare Exorsists And Stuff
We Can Do The Head Spin Thing And The Creepy Laughing
Itll Be Fun 

I Hope Youre Off Being Like The Worlds Coolest Gay And Stuff
Youre Always Disappearing And Coming Back With Wild Stories
Its Upsetting That Im Not There With You When You Get Up To Your Scooby Doo Esque Hijinks And All Those Small Oddities You Tell Me About
But The Fact That You Tell Me About Them Makes The Distance Feel....Alright

Thanks For Being The Bestest Moirail Anybodys Ever Had
Youre A Life Saver <3
Love You Soooooooooooooooo Much <sub>(And I Miss You A Crap Tonne Too)</sub>
Hope You Enjoyed Your Read <span style="color:#FF0000">Mwah</span>

This Is Gonna Get A Lot Longer

At Least I Wish That It Could
But My Motivation Is In A Deeper Pit Than A Wounded Ww2 Soldier 

You Never Check This But If You Ever Do Can We Talk Aboug How Hot You Are? Youre Like Illegaly Attractive And I Want To Know How You Pull It Off
Magic Right?

I Love The Way Your Brain Works, When Your Brain Works, And Id Love It If You Keep Showing Me How Wonderful Your Insides Are ^^

Youre Adorable Sunshine

Keep Seeing Tma Tiktoks I Cant Send You

Im Sorry To Hear About Your Gag Reflex; It Sounds Like Super Annoying (Not Even Just In Terms Of Fun Time) 
What If We Just Took away Your Throat? You Wouldnt Be Able To Use It For Anything But You <b>Would</b> Be Able To Not Chock On Things....Because You Have Nothing To Choke On

Also Gonna Leave This Quote From The Other Day "Then Whats The Guilt For"

I Will Say Its Sometimes Hard To Tell The Difference Between You Staying At Home And My Notifications Being Broken
You Not Messaging Me For Sixteen Hours Doesnt Really Mean Anything (Really Could Be Because Of Either) So I Kinda Just Have To Check Every Now And Then
Id Check Up On You But That Doesn't....Do Anything 

Also
![IMG-20240302-WA0000.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240302-WA0000.jpg)
Those Look So Good And I Cant Believe You Didnt Give Me Any >:(
Youre Evil!!

I Havent Updated This In So Long
I Still Think About Our Pizza All The Time, I Wish I Could Have Been In That Moment Forever

When I First Met Vesper She Was So Small. Like Talking To Her Was The Verbal Equivalent Of When A Kitten Sleeps On Your Lap 
I Know Theyve Been Through A Lot Both Before And After Having Met And I Feel Bad That I Couldn't Protect Them From Any Of That But At The Same Time Look How Xe's Grown
Im So Proud Of Him And So Honored That I Can Spend Time With Him
At The Same Time I Feel Like Im Always Such a Bother To Them, And I'll Always Be Sorry About That Even Though He Tells Me Its Okay
That Being Said: Thank You

Usually I Write These As Like A Detailed Explanaition Of Who The Person Is Like "Vespers Favourite Ice Cream Is Strawberry Cheesecake" But I Dont Know How To Describe You In Any Wya T sOmeone Who Doesnt Already Know You. Like You Are One Of Those Wonder That You Need To See to Believe. I Could Just Turn This Into A List Of Things I Like About You: i LIke How She Interacts With People That She Loves/Cares About, I Like How She Complains About The Things That Annoy Him, Hes Both Good At Dealing With People And Bad At Putting Up With People, They Get Excited About Some Of The Smallest Things And Its Adorable But They Are Just As Capable Of Being Excited Over The Bigger Aspects Of Life, I Love How That Can Contrast Against My Opinion On Some Things, The Way He Talks About Things Always Warm My Heart And Im Pretty Sure He Feels THe Same About My Random Rambling

I Keep Thinking I Should Update This But Im Worried That You dont Want Me To
I Also Just Realised The Link Might Have Changed since I Last Sent This To You...


Baking, Stargazing, Outside, Olive Garden, Movie, Could Have A Nice Night Picnic


Didnt Re4spond To My Happy Birthday But Sure Whatever

She got That Tattoo She Wanted, Im Happy For Her

Its Strange Watching Someone Who's So Far Away
Trying To Enjoy Their Happieness Without Being Able To Bask In It
But Im Glad You Have People Who Can Be Wrapped Up In Your Light
I Just Hope That They Appreciate It As Much As I Do
