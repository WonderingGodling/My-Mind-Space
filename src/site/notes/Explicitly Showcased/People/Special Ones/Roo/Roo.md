Roo Is Definitely Interesting And If Im Being Honest Theres Not Much Else To Say On That
I'll Never Fully Understand How (Or Even If) Their Brain Works But I Will Admit I Enjoy When It Breaks
 I End Up Having To Explain A Lot Of Stuff To Them But Honestly They Always Feel Too Bad About It For Me To Actually Be Upset


I Left Roos Shirt At Their Place D:

Talked To Roo While Playing Stardew And Theyve Actually Gotten Better At The Game; They Still Like Fishing Though So Idk

Wow I Never Add To This </3
Thats Honestly A Shame; They Should Get More Attention Every Now And Then

[[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Desolation Lonely Maybe?
Thats A Weird Dynamic; Possibly Eye
Its Just That Amongst The Desolation Behaviour Theirs A Layer Of "Oh No, Please Dont Try To Hurt [[Branches/Me\|Me]]" Could Be As A Defence Or Even An Offence (Like A Dart Frog Or An Angler Fish)
It Could Also Be Completely Seperate; I Guess What Im Trying To Say Is The Push And Pull Game They Play Can Either Be For Fun Or By Nature And Those Two Things Mean Completely Different Manifestations 
Anti Web Definitely

Oh Yeah, Me, Roo Might Not Be Able To Hang Out On The Twenty-Nineth So Try To Accost Them At Some Point

"I Saw A Tweet Earlier About A Guy Getting Hard Kissing His Girlfriend (Got Popular Because Everyone Was Bullying Him)
Anyway I Was Gonna Be Like "This Is You" But I Forgot And Now The Accounts Gone" "


Flesh I Think Idk I'll Come Back To This (As Always)

Wish I Could Write Way More About That Day But The Depression Is Making It A Blur

Oh Yeah Roo Wants To Watch Inside Out 2
I Said No Because Its Probably Shit

"drank 2 pints of coffee and desperatly need to pee while waiting for the bus rn" Deserved Also It Was Hot And Cold Coffee Because They Cant Be Normal For One Second

When In London With Dee They Went To A Kink Shop With Monster Dildos, "Clone A Cock", Floggers, Paddles, Costumes And Masks

"i wish u were here with us ♡....woulve been an awesome threesome"

We Also Went To Paramo Lounge And I Had A Brisket Chilly Thing That Was Okay But Also A Side Of Rice Which Was Less Okay

Roo Had Never Seen One Before And Thought It Was Pretty

Roo Should Give Me Head Frfr

They Were Meant To Give Me A Tshirt And Underwear How Dare She Forget >:((

Also Can Confirm That They Want To Be Broken Open
