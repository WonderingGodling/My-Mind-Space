Roo Is Definitely Interesting And If Im Being Honest Theres Not Much Else To Say On That
I'll Never Fully Understand How (Or Even If) Their Brain Works But I Will Admit I Enjoy When It Breaks
 I End Up Having To Explain A Lot Of Stuff To Them But Honestly They Always Feel Too Bad About It For [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Actually Be Upset


I Left Roos Shirt At Their Place D:

Talked To Roo While Playing Stardew And Theyve Actually Gotten Better At The Game; They Still Like Fishing Though So Idk

Wow I Never Add To This </3
Thats Honestly A Shame; They Should Get More Attention Every Now And Then

Oh Yeah, [[Branches/Me\|Me]], Roo Might Not Be Able To Hang Out On The Twenty-Nineth So Try To Accost Them At Some Point

Flesh I Think Idk I'll Come Back To This (As Always)
