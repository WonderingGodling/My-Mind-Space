# Roodolf

I've Decided That I Need To Write A More In-Depth Manifest Of This One And To Make It Public While Im At It. If This Isnt Too Interesting Thats Honestly Expected But You Can Fuck Off; Don't Insult My Favourite Slut. 
Simple.

So Roo Is Most Certainly Interesting So If I Dont Hold Back I Feel As Though I Could Have A Lot To Say, However, I Think This Shouldnt Just Be A Dump And Should Instead Be Somewhat Structured And So....

## Introduction

First Thing I Want To Say About My Roodolf (They/Them) Is That I Didnt Ask If I Can Call Them That And They Dont Have The Option To Veto This ^^
The Second Thing Is That I Swear That I Will Never Fully Understand The Fire Raging In Their Head, This Isnt Going To Be Helpful To You, I Dont Know If This Will Be Helpful To Me If Im Completely honest
Also, If There Arent Any Already, There Will Be Links To Other Parts Of My Website, Get As Distracted As You Want <3

## Bio (Kinda)

So, If You Dont Know, Roo (Originally █████ ██████) Is A They/them Pain In The Ass That Ive Been Friends With Since Some Point 2019(?)  Im Bad At Time But I Remember That It Was Pre-Lockdown At Talliah ████'s Party. They Were Such A Huge Weeb That They Wore A Tokyo Ghoul Shirt To Like A Party Party Because Thats Like Cool Right? 
Doesnt Matter, I Own That Shirt Now So I Win, They Had Fun, Talli's Dead Or Something (I Dont Know) But Everybodys Happy....
Can I Link To Within The Page.... [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/STOWAWAY SLUT (FREE)#Roo's Shirt\|Shirt]] 
Thanks Now I Know That

### Alignment

If I Had To Guess, Roodolf Is A Time Player Who Would Easily Sink Into The Desolation If Given Half A Chance, I Also Feel Like The Hunt Wouldnt Be A Terrible Guess? Animalistic And All That
While We're On The Topic, They Are Terrified Of Spiders <3


## Likes And Stuff

### Likes

Roo, Like Many, Really Likes True Crime Documentaries; I Wouldnt Call It An Obsession But Its Noticable
Obviously A Bratz Fan

#### Loves

##### The Hots
Roo Said To Include Everything So I Cant Forget To Mention Their Insane Thirst For Godzilla, Mothra, Ghost Face, Your Mom, Cthulu, They Would Fuck A Werewolf, They Wouldnt Fuck A Really Big Dog (Consent Is Important)
Also **Major** Piss Kink

### Dislikes

Apparently They D0 Not Like Dolls, I Will Keep- I Dont Need To Keep That In Mind, Its Written Down Now

#### Hates


#### Roo's Shirt
Tokyo Ghoul, Cute Other Stuff I'll Write Later
