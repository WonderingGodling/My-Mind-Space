# Good Day
I Hung Out With Dee Today (The Light Of My Life, Beacon Of Hope And The Best Woman Since Adam Got Married) And She Is Always So Freaking Amazing!
We Went To Spoons For Lunch Then I Kinda Just Escorted Her Through The Completion Of A Errands; She Also Let [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Borrow An Old Shirt And After All That My Whole Day Has Been Made
Living Proof That Spiders Can Be Lovely 
On That Topic No Clue What Aspect They Are

I Got To Hang Out With Dee Like All Day-- 
(This App sucks (Crashed))
Anyway Got To Hers In The Wet, That Was Sad, But I Got A Hug And Some Tea Out Of It, Then We Watched Gravity Falls While I Failed To Source Cabin In The Woods Before Switching To The Goldbergs Then To Sweeny Todd
Dee Fell Asleep At One Point So I Took A Picture, Shes Cute (And Dhe Breathes Differently When Shes Asleep Which I Think Is Interesting) And I Love Her And Eventually [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Showed Up And We Watched Most Of Hazbin Hotel (We Didnt Finish Episode Seven)
Also Excellent Bean Burgers 10/10
I Could Write So Much More Because This Was Such An Awesome Day But I Wont Because Privacy And Whatnot
However I Will Say Im Sad That I Didnt Wear Black Nails Lile I Pmanned Because Dee Did And I Got A Nice Picture Of Us Holding Hands 

I Just love Dee So Much

Dee Really Liked Kitkats, Her Favourite Are The Macha Ones

Dee: Macha Late
Also Likes Careot Cake
Not A Coconut Fan
Is Adorable 


Favourite Bird Is Duck Because Ducks Feel Friendly And Hates Geese And Swans Because Opposite 
Really Needs To Slow Down And Stop Doing So Much But She Feels Like Shes Not Doing Enough In Terms Of Socialising And Rolling In The Dough 
I Got Info On Her Favourite Radiohead Album But Thats Gone Now :p 

96· Again Real Quick, We Went To Kings Heath And Myphone Updated Twice, Dee Had Something From That Chicken Shop But I Wasnt Hungry So I Didnt Eat
We Went To A Bookstore Ive Never Seen, Dee Found A Cool Birmingham Music Book For Her Dad, And We Chilled In The Park For A Bit Watching Ducks (I Think Ive Alreay Mentioned That Part Earlier But Whatever)

98· Me, Dee, Roo, Xander Met Up (That Was Me And Xanders 8th) And We Went To Ruberry, Frankies And Watched Monkey Man Which Was A Gorgeous Dev Patel Film ^^
