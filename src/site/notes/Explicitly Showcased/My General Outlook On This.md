# My General Outlook On This

Ive Been Working On This For A Bit Now And Honestly I Dont Think Its Going To Have Too Big Of An Impact On My Life But The Thing Is I Need Something To Do And This Is Certainly Something To Do

Itll Be Fun To Docment And Share Stuff And I Guess Have An Outlet For My Thoughts And Stuff That Extends Past A Piece Of Paper Confined In My Bedroom But Other Than That This Is Just Gonna Be Something Else That Gets Added To The Interest Graveyard

Over Time (Knowing Me) Im Going To Forget I Have This Or That I Can Speak To People Indirectly And Go Back To Being Unsatisfied With My Indirect Communication But Until Then Im Going To Keep Updating This And Adding My Thoughts And Links In Places That Make Sense To Me

At The Moment Not Everything Can Me Accessed
For Example [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Phobophilia\|This]] Is The Only Way To See That Note
But Maybe Over Time Thatll Change
Who Knows
