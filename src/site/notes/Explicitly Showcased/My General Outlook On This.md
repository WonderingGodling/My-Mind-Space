# Original

Ive Been Working On This For A Bit Now And Honestly I Dont Think Its Going To Have Too Big Of An Impact On My Life But The Thing Is I Need Something
Itll Be Fun To Document And Share Stuff And I Guess Have An Outlet For My Thoughts And Stuff That Extends Past A Piece Of Paper Confined In My Bedroom But Other Than That This Is Just Gonna Be Something Else That Gets Added To The Interest Graveyard

Over Time (Knowing Me) Im Going To Forget I Have This Or That I Can Speak To People Indirectly And Go Back To Being Unsatisfied With My Indirect Communication But Until Then Im Going To Keep Updating This And Adding My Thoughts And Links In Places That Make Sense To Me

Also Planning On Adding A Guestbook Or Something

# Post Launch

At The Moment Not Everything Can Be Accessed  
For Example [[This\|This]] Is The Only Way To See That Note  
But Maybe Over Time Thatll Change (That Has Changed Cheers)  
Who Knows

Oh And Also There Are Some Note Links That Exist But Lead Nowhere  
Thats Because I Dont Want To Publish Everything Online (Story Idea Spoilers, Backend Connecters And Other Stuff) So Those Might Just Stay Broken  
Also On My End Ive Got Little Icons Next To Filess And Stuff And There Isnt A Simple Way To Treansfer Those To The [[Website\|Website]] Which Is A Pain In The Ass

# Zoochosis

It Has Come To My Attention (Via [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] What I Think Is Best For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]) That Since I Am Undergoing Zoochosis And That The Enrichment Time That I Usually Try To Provide Myself With Is A Failing Method, The Best Thing For [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Do For My Mental Health Is To Empty The Beehive More Frequently; The Problem Isnt My Mind, It's Keeping My Mind Locked Iniside Of Itself  
This [Website](https://my-mind-space.vercel.app/) Will See The Biggest Hit In Terms Of My Increase In Esoteric

# Mid Zoochosis

Adding To This (19·2023 44.97) Its Hard To Add To This While My Mental State Is On The Move, My Mnind Has To Settle In Order For The Production To Carry Forward  
What Does This Mean? There Are Gaps In The Masterpiece, Holes Populating Within The Tapestry
