# My General Outlook On This

Ive Been Working On This For A Bit Now And Honestly I Dont Think Its Going To Have Too Big Of An Impact On My Life But The Thing Is I Need Something To Do And This Is Certainly Something To Do

Itll Be Fun To Document And Share Stuff And I Guess Have An Outlet For My Thoughts And Stuff That Extends Past A Piece Of Paper Confined In My Bedroom But Other Than That This Is Just Gonna Be Something Else That Gets Added To The Interest Graveyard

Over Time (Knowing Me) Im Going To Forget I Have This Or That I Can Speak To [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Indirectly And Go Back To Being Unsatisfied With My Indirect Communication But Until Then Im Going To Keep Updating This And Adding My Thoughts And Links In Places That Make Sense To Me

At The Moment Not Everything Can [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Accessed
For Example [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Phobophilia\|This]] Is The Only Way To See That Note
But Maybe Over Time Thatll Change
Who Knows

Oh And Also There Are Some Note Links That Exist But Lead Nowhere
Thats Because I Dont Want To Publish Everything Online (Story Idea Spoilers, Backend Connecters And Other Stuff) So Those Might Just Stay Broken
