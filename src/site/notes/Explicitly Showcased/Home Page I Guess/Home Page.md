# My Mind Is A Mess But You Can Sit Wherever You Like

Im Going To Be Sharing A Large Amount Of Of The Things I Think And Experience And Whatever And Its Not Going To Be Very Organised Or Anything So Youll Just Have To Live With It

As, I Suppose, A Mental Health Thing Im Going To Be Devoting A Portion Of My Brain Into An Archival Little Corner Or The Internet
This Probably Wont Achieve Much But Its Not Nothing
If You Want To Have A Look Around (If You **Can**) Look Around Feel Free
Get Comfortable

You Want Some [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Mad Rambles]] To Start You Off Or Something?
Make Yourself At Home

If Youre [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunny]] Click There
And This Is For You [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Honey\|Honey]]

Also Some People Wanted To Deliver Some Messages To A Bunch Of Internet Strangers So.... [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Relay 1\|Relay 1]] [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Relay 2\|Relay 2]]

[[Explicitly Showcased/My General Outlook On This\|My General Outlook On This]]



###### You Got To The End
