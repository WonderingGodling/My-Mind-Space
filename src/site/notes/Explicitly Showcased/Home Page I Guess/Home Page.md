# My Mind Is A Mess But You Can Sit Wherever You Like

Im Going To Be Sharing A Large Amount Of Of The Things I Think And Experience And Whatever And Its Not Going To Be Very Organised Or Anything So Youll Just Have To Live With It

As, I Suppose, A Mental Health Thing Im Going To Be Devoting A Portion Of My Brain Into An Archival Little Corner Or The Internet
This Probably Wont Achieve Much But Its Not Nothing
If You Want To Have A Look Around (If You *Can*) Look Around Feel Free
Get Comfortable
