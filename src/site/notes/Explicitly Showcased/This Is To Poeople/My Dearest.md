# <span style="color:#800085">I Just Wanted You To Know....</span>

I Dont Know If You'll Ever Read This But If You Are Thats Great, I Hope You Enjoyed The Smaller One I Wrote To You. I Just Wanted To Give You <b>Something</b> Yknow And I Couldn't Think Of Anything Else That Wouldn't Be Uncomfortably Close To Either Of Our Boundaries And 
Honestly I Didnt Really Think Id Even Manage To Get That To You And Yet....Here We Are
Im Proud Of Both Of Us
I Hope Youre Okay Whenever Youre Reading This

Im Being Awkward Through Text
Autism Be Like
Im Not Used To Monologuing On Purpose But I Wanna Write Something For You On Here
Something More Than I Already Have

‍​ 

First I Want You To Know Youre Important To Me Like Specifically You Are Specifically Important To Me And My Life
I Cant Really Explain Why But I Just Hate The Idea Of Not Having You In My Life
Maybe In The Future Thatll Change; Human Emotions Are Always Weird And Unpredictable But Though I Dont Know If I'll...(Is It Weird That I Wanna Say Crave)
I Dont Know If I'll Fight For You To Stay In My Life Forever But I Do Know I'll Always Want You In My Life 
Like Im Cooking Dinner Every Day And Trying (Failing) To Drag You Away From Work; I Might Not Call You One Evening But I'll Still Set The Table
Thats Cringe And Sappy But I Needed An Analogy
Its Hard Enough For Me To Write In A Way Thats Coherent And Not Just Cryptic Chaos

All That To Say Your Existence Matters To Me And You Need To Know That Going Forwards
"Know" Like You Know If You Jump You'll Land Rather Than "Know" As In Be Able To Repeat Off By Heart
Of Course Feel Free To Repeat It

How Is The Future By The Way? Your Future That Is
If Im In It I'd Love To Stay Updated
If Im Not Tell Me Anyway? Idk How Plausible That Is If Im Not There But It ~~Would~~ Might Be Nice

I Know Theres Not Much Point To Any Of This But Theres Not Much Point To Most Things When You Think About It
The End Goal Is To Be Happy And Healthy; Enjoy Yourself Now Or Later
Crying Is Also An Option
A Sader Option But It Does Actually Help Quite A Lot

I Was Thinking Actually (I Do That Too Often)
There Are So Many Fights In Life That We Go Through, Most Of Which Feel Rather Pointless But You Still Find Yourself Struggling Against The Problem And Every Time You Find Yourself Caught In One I Cant Help But Wish I Could Make Your Plight Vanish Into Thin Air
Like
It Doesn't Feel Right That I Can Exist In A Reality <b>And</b> That You Can Experience Negativity Which I Know Is A Very Wrong Way To Think
I Cant Stop You (Or Anyone) From Ever Being Sad But That Doesn't Really Stop The Feeling Of
You Know When Youre On A Roller Coaster With A Large Drop?
The Second The Drop Starts, Not The Moment Before Of Anticipation, Not The Falling Feeling During The Drop, The Exact Point At Which Your Brain Aknowledges The Descent
Its A Combination Of "Of Course The Ride Dips, We Saw It And We Climbed It" And "We Shouldnt Be Moving Down This Fast, Thats How Death Happens" And Of Course Youre Fine Afterwards, You Know Youre Going To Be Fine Afterwards And Maybe You Loved It And You Do It Again But The Exact Same Emotions Pass Over You
That 
Thats How I Feel Every Time I Hear Youre Having A Bad Day
I Know Youll Be Okay Though
It Used To Be Hope But The More I Know You The More I Feel Like Youll Get Through This One
Then The Same Tomorrow And Tomorrow And Tomorrow
All Difficulty Passes, As Does Some Joy But Theres Always More

Im Not Writing This To Make You Feel Better
I Never Do Anything Explicitly To Make You Feel Better
I Know Youd Hate That So I Avoid It
And Id Rather Any Reassurance I Provide Be Genuine
Thats Not My Point Though My Point Is That Im Not A Hundred Percent On Why Im Saying Any Of This Other Than I Feel As Though It Needs To Be Said
Youre An Artist So You Know What Its Like To Create
Its Like The Thing Already Exists And You Just Need To Be The One To Prove It
Well I Write Because All These Facts And [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Thoughts]] Are Using Up Universes Of Space And I Need Them To Be Made "Real" To More Than Just Me And
Well Id Spill All My Guts To You Simply Because I Think You Might Want To Listen
Even This
I Wrote You A Cute Little Letter About How Amazing You Are (Which Again Wasnt The Point Of The Note It Just Needed To Be Said) But I Gave You The Link To This Instead
Because Maybe Its Something Youd Like To Read
Maybe Its Not
Maybe Youre Hating Every Second Of It
Maybe Youve Not Even Gotten This Far
Shows What I Know About You
Youre One Of My favourite People So I Wish To Know More But That Goes Without Saying
You Should Know You Light Up My Existence By Now So Why Wouldn't I Want More


<span style="color:#F0F8FF">Did You Know That Alice Blue Is Its Own Specific Shade  ​‍#f0f8ff Theres Like No Way You Didnt Know That But Now You Know The Hex Code</span>

If I Could Have Any Well Known Superpower It Would Be Teleportation
One Of The Things I Hate Most About The Universe Is Time Existing And If I Could Move Across Continents Instantly I Could Just Pretend It Doesnt
At Least That The Main Reason
I Know Id Use It More To Spend Time With The People That I Love
If I Could Be Anywhere, Where And When Are Things I Couldn't Care About But Who Would Be The Most Important Thing To Me
Sure, Id Love A Trip To Italy But Why Would I Do That Alone? 
Equally Id Love To Spend Time With You, Why Not Do That At Home?
Also I Could Fuck With People By Impossibly Being In Places Which Is A Bonus

Im Glad I Have You In My Life
You Might Feel Like A Burden Some Times But Trust Me When I Say You Make My Life So Much Easier
When People Are Driving Me Insane I Remember That Some People Are Worth It And Actually Make Me Happy
It Helps Me Not Be Antagonistic 
Sometimes 
I Really Want To Be Antagonistic 

I Know Youre Trying To Be A Better Person And All And You Know I Think Youre Perfect
But I Just Wanted You To Know That You Trying Is Actually Helping Me Too
And I Guess If Youre "Better" Then Other Peoples Lives Are Improved To
So On Behalf Of Everyone: Thanks, We Appreciate Your Hard Work
Directly From Me Though? 
I Only Really Care That Youre Happy
If I Need To Burn Buildings For You To Achieve That Then Name A Time And Place

Actually Seriously Though
If You Need Me Tell Me When And I'll Try






Keep Being A Blessing
