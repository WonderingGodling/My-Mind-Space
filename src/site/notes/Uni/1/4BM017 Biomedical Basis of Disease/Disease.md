## Week 3 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Case Study 1)
### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is
A complex metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia (excessive blood sugar).
It arises from the body's inability to use insulin properly (insulin resistance) combined with insulin deficiency.
This prevents the uptake of glucose which is a cells primary energy source (from carbohydrates).

### Insulin's Role & Insulin Resistance
Insulin's Role: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. It allows glucose to enter cells (through blood), for energy.

Insulin Resistance: In T2DM, cells don't respond to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter cells.

### Pathogenesis
#### Insulin Resistance
Reduced tissue sensitivity- Cells in muscles, fat, and liver become less responsive to insulin decreasing glucose uptake and utilisation.

Increased glucose production- The liver produces more glucose, contributing to hyperglycaemia

#### Impaired Insulin Secretion
Beta-cell dysfunction- The pancreatic beta cells gradually lose their ability to secrete enough insulin to overcome resistance.

Progressive decline- Cell function deteriorates worsening hyperglycaemia

### Laboratory Features & Diagnostic Criteria
#### HbA1C Test (Glycated Haemoglobin Test)
Measures average blood glucose over 3 months. 
6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. 
HbA1c provides an average of blood glucose over 2–3 months due to the lifespan of red blood cells being 120 days.

#### Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test
Measures blood glucose after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours) to establish a baseline. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes.

#### Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
Measures blood sugar level before and 2 hours after drinking a sugary liquid (75g). A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes

#### Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test
Measures blood sugar level at any time of day. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes, indicates diabetes.

### Management Strategies?
#### 1st Line of Management: Life-style modifications
- Dietary Modifications
- Weight Management
- Regular Physical Activity
- Smoking Cessation

#### 2nd Line of Management: Medications
- Metformin- Increase insulin sensitivity & decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis
- Gliclazide- Stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin
- Sitagliptin- Enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion
- Linagliptin- Increase incretin hormone levels, which enhance insulin release and  decrease glucagon secretion

#### 3rd Line of Management - Injectable Therapy – Insulin  
- If oral medications aren't sufficient to achieve target blood sugar levels.  
- There are rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, and premixed insulins.  
- Insulin therapy may involve multiple daily injections or the use of an insulin pump.

##### Sites of Insulin Injection  
Abdomen: preferred site due to consistent absorption. Avoid the area around the belly button and any scars.  
Thighs: middle/outer part of thigh.  
Upper Arms: The back of the upper arm can be used, but it may be difficult to reach.  
Buttocks: The upper outer area of the buttocks

### Case Study  
Brian, a 52-year-old plasterer, presented to his general practitioner (GP) with complaints of persistent thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and slow-healing wounds. He reported no history of smoking and consumes approximately 20 units of alcohol per week. During the consultation, his blood pressure (BP) was recorded at 167/97 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI) was calculated as 34.3 kg/m². Initial blood tests revealed an elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 64 mmol/mol. This test was repeated to confirm the result, yielding a subsequent HbA1c of 68 mmol/mol.  
His total cholesterol measured 5.9 mmol/L, with a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol of 3.7 mmol/L. Based on these clinical findings, Brian was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The GP provided comprehensive counselling on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, increased physical activity, and weight management. Pharmacological intervention was initiated with metformin. Given Brian's elevated cholesterol levels and the increased cardiovascular risk associated with T2DM, the initiation of statin therapy is under strong consideration and will be discussed further at a follow-up appointment.

## Week 4 Alzheimer’s Disease (Case Study 2)

### Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Epidemiology
  
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes.  
- The prevalence of AD increases with age, affecting 1 in 14 people aged ≥65
- Women are more likely to develop AD than men (Nearly two-thirds)
- In the UK, AD is the most common cause of dementia (decline in thinking and memory), accounting for 62% of cases.  
- As of 2024, approximately 982,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, with this number projected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040.  
- In 2022, there were 74,261 deaths attributed to AD & other dementias in the UK

### Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of AD involves progressive brain cell damage caused by abnormal protein build-up.  
1. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)  
- Beta-amyloid proteins clump together outside brain cells due to abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase & gamma-secretase  
- These plaques disrupt communication between neurons and trigger inflammation.  
- Major hallmark of AD.  
- Exact cause still unknown

2. Tau Tangles (Intracellular)  
- Tau proteins, which normally stabilise brain cell structures, become abnormal.  
- They form tangles inside neurons, blocking nutrient transport and leading to cell death.

3. Neuroinflammation & Cell Death  
- The immune system reacts to plaques and tangles, causing chronic inflammation.  
- Brain cells (neurons) die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline.  
4. Brain Shrinkage (Atrophy)  
- Over time, widespread neuron loss causes the brain to shrink, especially in the hippocampus (memory centre).

### Symptoms
- Memory loss
- Difficulty finding words and speaking
- Confusion about time, place, and people
- misplacing items
- inability to find steps
- poor judgment/decision-making
- personality/behaviour changes
- difficulty completing familiar tasks
- loss of ability to recognise loved ones

### Risk Factors of Alzheimer’s Disease
1. Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease  increases significantly with age, especially after 65.  
2. Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease increases your risk of developing the disease.  
3. Genetics: Certain genetic variations, such as the APOE ε4 allele, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
4. Cardiovascular health: Conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]]
1. Medical History & Physical Examination 
 - Review of symptoms, family history, and lifestyle.  
 - Assessment of overall health, medications, and past illnesses.  
2. Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests  
- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) – Assesses memory, orientation, and problem- solving skills.  
- Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) – Detects mild cognitive impairment.  
- Clock Drawing Test – Evaluates visuospatial and executive function
3. Laboratory Tests  
- Genetic testing – APOE-ε4 gene testing may be done for hereditary risk.  
4. Brain Imaging  
- MRI or CT Scan – Detects brain shrinkage.  
- PET Scan – Identifies amyloid plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s.
5. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis (in some cases)  
 - Measures levels of amyloid and tau proteins linked to AD

| Category | Effects |
|:--------:|:-------:|
|      Amyloid Plaques    |   Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) → disrupts neuronal communication & triggers immune response      |
|    Tau Tangles      |   Hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules → forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) → disrupts intracellular transport → neuronal dysfunction & apoptosis.      |
|     Neuroinflammation     | Microglial activation fails to clear plaques → releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) → chronic inflammation causes neuronal damage        |
|    Oxidative Stress & Mitochondrial Dysfunction      | Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired mitochondrial function → reduced ATP production, energy failure, and neuronal apoptosis        |
|   Neurotransmitter Deficiency       | Loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain → decreased acetylcholine (ACh) → impaired memory and learning. Glutamate dysregulation causes excitotoxicity, further damaging neurons        |
|     Synaptic & Neuronal Loss     |Progressive synapse loss & brain atrophy (hippocampus & cortex) → cognitive decline, impaired motor function, and eventual loss of vital functions.         |


### Treatment & Management Strategies
#### Medications
##### Cholinesterase inhibitors  
- Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that encodes and recalls memories in the hippocampus.  
- Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter.  
 - Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors combat the decreased levels of acetylcholine from AD.  
- These medications prevent acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine

##### Memantine  
- Works by regulating the neurotransmitter glutamate
- Memantine helps improve cognitive function 
- Binds to NMDA receptors, which are involved in glutamate signalling.  
- Blocking these receptors, helps to reduce the overstimulation of glutamate and protect nerve cells from further damage.

##### Aducanumab and Lecanemab  
Recently approved  for early-stage AD monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaques in the brain to slow down cognitive declin

#### Non-pharmacological approaches  
##### Cognitive stimulation therapy  
Engaging in activities that stimulate cognitive functions, such as memory, problem-solving, and language.  
##### Reminiscence therapy  
Discussing past experiences and memories, often using prompts like photos or music, to improve mood and well-being.  
##### Behavioural therapies  
Helps manage behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with Alzheimer's, such as agitation, anxiety, and depression.  
##### Lifestyle modifications  
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social engagement can also help support brain health and potentially slow down the progression of Alzheimer's.

### Case Study  
A 63-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of repetitiveness, memory loss, and executive function loss beginning at age 58. This progressed to include word-finding difficulties, visuospatial skill decline, and impaired instrumental activities of daily living. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14/30 at the initial visit, with poor verbal fluency, visuospatial, and executive skills. Brain MRI at age 58 showed mild generalized cortical atrophy. Based on these findings, a clinical [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) was made. Treatment included cholinesterase inhibitors, which initially improved her MMSE score to 18/30. Later, memantine was added due to further cognitive decline (MMSE=13/30). She died at age 63 of pneumonia. A post-mortem examination confirmed the EOAD [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]], revealing numerous plaques and tangles, congophilic amyloid  angiopathy, and Lewy Body pathology in the amygdala. Genetic testing, conducted three years before her death, identified a novel PSEN2 mutation (L221T) and an apolipoprotein E (apoE) ε3/4 genotype

# Week 6 Cardiovascular Disease

### CASE STUDY 
Mr Leon Brown, a 62-year-old male, presented at A&E with chest pain which started when he was running for a bus. Following a medical examination he was found to be overweight (body mass index 28 kg/m2), his blood pressure was 168/103 mmHg, and his total cholesterol levels 240 mg/dL (6.21 mmol/L). His ECG showed some signs of myocardial ischaemia, but no permanent cardiac damage. Mr Brown was diagnosed with stable angina and was offered lifestyle advice and support to help him lower his BP and cholesterol. He was prescribed GTN (to relieve chest pain), ramipril (to lower BP) and atorvastatin (to lower cholesterol). He was booked in for angiogram procedure to visualise the blood flow in the coronary arteries.

### Coronary Circulation  
- The heart gets blood through coronary arteries (from aorta)
If flow is reduced you get Angina Pectoris and if it stops you get Myocardial Infarction

Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries reduces flow

#### 3 pathologic stages  
1. The fatty streak  
- No symptoms  
2. Plaque progression  
- Angina  
3. Plaque disruption
 - myocardial infarction

##### The fatty streak  
Endothelial injury – leads to its dysfunction  
Physical stressors (E.g. high BP)  
Chemical stressors  (E.g. smoking or high cholesterol)  
![](https://i.imgur.com/QgVIQtb.png)

##### Plaque Progression  
![](https://i.imgur.com/y4A5Wrk.png)


### Angina Pectoris
- Chest pain  
	- Most common symptom  
	- Pain: dull, heavy, tight,  squeeze, or ache  
	- Radiates:  
		- Chest, arm or jaw  
- Associated with:  
	- SOB  
	- Sweating  
	- Nausea and vomiting

![](https://i.imgur.com/fIllMJQ.png)
Both cause [[Uni/myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]]

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]]  
#### Electrocardiogram - ECG  
ST segment depression Due to ischaemia  
His ECG showed some signs of [[Uni/myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]], but no permanent cardiac damage.

#### Stress testing -  exercise  
- Exercise on treadmill or cycle ergometer  
- HR, BP & ECG monitored  
- Aim for 85% of max HR  
- Positive test  
	- Angina pain develops  
	- Ischaemic signs on ECG  
		- ‘ST depression’  
	- STOP test!
##### Pharmacological and nuclear imaging
- Inject a coronary vasodilator  
	- Ischaemic regions already  maximally vasodilated so as other regions dilate they steal blood from the diseased areas  
	- Areas that are poorly perfused do  not get as much of the radionucleotide which is injected –  look like a ‘cold spot’ on the image  
- Inject a sympathomimetic  
	- Activates adrenergic receptors  
	- Increase force of contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy) – mimics exercise  

### Risk Factors for Developing CAD - [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Aetiology\|aetiology]]  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2Y6FVgp.png)

#### Smoking  
\>1 pack a day increases the death rate from ischaemic heart disease by 200% through
-  modification of LDL  
- Endothelial dysfunction  
- platelet adhesiveness  
- Activation of sympathetic NS  
#### Obesity  
In the UK 1 in 6 deaths due to CVD are associated with a high body-mass index
#### High blood pressure  
5 x greater risk of IHD if BP >165/95 mmHg caused by
-  wall stress – endothelial damage  
-  foam cell formation  
-  retention of LDL in vessel wall  

#### Diabetes Mellitus  
- Adults with diabetes are more 2-3 times more likely to develop  
cardiovascular disease and People with diabetes are twice as likely to die from heart disease because of
-  modification of LDL for macrophage uptake by High glucose
-  foam cell formation  
- More prone to thrombosis  
- Endothelial dysfunction from damage by high blood glucose

### Treatment of CAD  
Treatment aims to:  
- Reduce disease progression  
- Improve myocardial blood flow (oxygen supply)  
- Reduce myocardial work (oxygen demand)  
- Match supply and demand

#### Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)  
Formation of nitric oxide  
- Vascular smooth muscle relaxation  
- Causes dilation of arteries and veins  
- Reduces preload (myocardial O2 demand)  
- Dilate coronary vasculature   
- Incraese myocardial O2 supply

#### Preventative Treatment: Reduce risk factors  
- Angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors  
Enhances vasodilation and diuresis  
- Beta adrenergic receptors 
- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins)  
Lower cholesterol levels  

#### Surgical intervention: Angioplasty
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
- Blockage >50%  
- No response to other  treatment  
- Several arteries affected  

Method  
- Use a ‘spare’ vessel (E.g. Saphenous (leg) vein)  
- Internal mammary artery  


## week 7 Mental Health

Emily is a 45-year-old woman who has been experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety for the past few months. She reports feeling sad, hopeless, and irritable most days. Additionally, she has trouble sleeping, lacks energy, and has lost interest in activities she used to enjoy. Emily mentions that her menstrual cycles have become irregular, and she often experiences hot flashes and night sweats. She has no significant medical history other than being perimenopausal. Emily was diagnosed with Perimenopausal Depression.

### perimenopause

Refers to the transitional phase that women experience before reaching menopause. It typically begins several years before menopause, which is the point when a woman stops menstruating entirely.  
- During perimenopause, hormonal fluctuations occur, leading to various physical and emotional symptoms such as irregular periods, hot flashes and mood swings.  
- This phase can last for several years, and it marks the gradual decline in ovarian function and hormone production before menopause occurs.  
- Typically begins from age 40 onwards

### Mental Health Disorders  
Anxiety disorders:  
Patients respond to certain objects or situations or objects with fear and dread.  
Feeling of unease, worry.  
Show physical signs of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating.  
Diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the  
person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal  
functioning.  
Examples: generalised anxiety disorder; panic disorder; social anxiety disorder,  
and phobias.  

Mood disorders: 
Involve persistent feelings of sadness or fluctuations from extreme elation to  
extreme sadness. Physical symptoms include sleep disturbance, fatigue.  
Examples: depression, bipolar disorder.

Depresssion  
Patients with a pre-existing major depressive disorder – prior to perimenopause, are at  
risk of relapse in the perimenopausal period and may find that anti-depressants that  
they may have been previously prescribed are perhaps no longer effective, or that a  
much higher dose is required to have the same effect.  

Anxiety  
Anxiety symptoms are often a hallmark of perimenopause and are more likely to occur in those with a pre-existing [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] or sensitivity towards anxiety.  
Anxiety symptoms are strongly linked to vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), with anxiety symptoms preceding the onset of vasomotor symptoms.  

Risk factors;  
Women with a history of premenstrual syndrome and postnatal depression are at a  
particular risk Pre-existing depression/anxiety prior to perimenopause;

Anxiety in Depression (in general)  
- Anxiety is common in the context of depression.  
- Anxiety symptoms often appear 1 year or 2 years ahead of the onset of major depression, and with increasing age, become a more pronounced feature of major depressive episodes.  
- High levels of anxiety are associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness and greater likelihood of non-response to treatment

- Approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year.  
- In England, 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental health problem (such as anxiety and depression) in any given week  
- 1 in 100 women will experience depression during perimenopause/menopause  
- Most women (8 out of 10) experience some symptoms, typically lasting about 4 years after the last period, but continuing for up to 12 years in about 10% of women. Incidence

#### Symptoms

#### Mechanisms of disease
- Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in Oestrogen and progesterone levels during perimenopause are believed to play a significant role in the development of mood disturbances. Oestrogen has known effects on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, which are involved in mood regulation. Changes in hormone levels can disrupt the delicate balance of these neurotransmitters, contributing to symptoms of depression and anxiety.  
- Neuroendocrine Dysregulation: The hormonal changes associated with perimenopause can also impact the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key neuroendocrine system involved in the body's stress response. Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, including depression and anxiety.  
- Neurotransmitter Imbalance: In addition to Oestrogen, other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, may also be dysregulated during perimenopause, contributing to mood disturbances. Changes in the levels or activity of these neurotransmitters can affect emotional processing and mood regulation.  
- Genetic Predisposition: Genetic factors may predispose some individuals to develop depression and anxiety during perimenopause. Family history of mood disorders can increase the risk of experiencing similar symptoms during the menopausal transition.

Monoamine neurotransmitters  
Serotonin helps regulate sleep, appetite, and mood and inhibits pain. It is thought to play a role in motor, cognitive, and autonomic functions. Some depressed people have reduced serotonin levels. Noradrenaline constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure. It also seems to help determine motivation and reward. It may trigger anxiety and be involved in some types of depression. Dopamine is essential to movement. It also influences motivation and plays a role in how a person perceives reality. Also plays a role in cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviours.

- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological symptoms.  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the perimenopause and menopause, destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the menopause and thought to be linked to changes in mood.  

Fluctuating Hormones
- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological symptoms.  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the  neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the perimenopause and menopause, destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the menopause and thought to be linked to changes in mood

Affects of reducing levels of Oestrogen
- Hormonal fluctuations : changes in oestrogen, play a significant role in mood regulation.  
- Oestrogen, in particular, has an impact on serotonin and other neurotransmitters associated with mood.  
- Fluctuations in these hormones can disrupt the delicate balance, disruption of leading to mood disturbances.

Affects of reducing levels of Testosterone;  
- In addition to oestrogen, total and free testosterone levels decline with age, often beginning in the mid reproductive years.  
- There is evidence that transdermal testosterone therapy gives a meaningful improvement in psychological well-being as well as in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder.  

Affects of reducing levels of Progesterone;  
- Progesterone receptors are also found within the brain, and reduced levels of progesterone, although not seen to have a consistent impact on psychological well-being, can have an impact on menopausal symptomology which would otherwise lead to an increase in psychological distress.

Hypothalamic–Pituitary–adrenal axis changes in depression  
- One of the most consistent biological findings in more severe depression with melancholic features, and associated with changes in the HPA axis, is the increased amount of plasma cortisol.  
- This is caused by a combination of excessive stress related cortisol release and impaired glucocorticoid receptor- mediated feedback inhibition.  
- Notably, HPA axis changes are also associated with impaired cognitive function and a failure of HPA axis  normalisation with treatment is associated with poor clinical response and high relapse.

In the UK, the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] of perimenopause is typically based on clinical evaluation and assessment of symptoms, as well as consideration of a woman's age and menstrual history:  
Medical History: Require a detailed medical history, including information about menstrual patterns, symptoms experienced i.e. PMS/PND, and any relevant medical conditions or medications. It's important for women to provide accurate information about their symptoms and menstrual cycles, including the regularity and duration of periods.  
Physical Examination: A physical examination may be conducted to assess overall health and to rule out other conditions, this is not required if perimenopause is suspected.  
Laboratory Tests: No specific test to definitively diagnose perimenopause. May need to rule out other underlying conditions.  
Symptom Assessment: Evaluate the presence and severity of symptoms commonly  
associated with perimenopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, sleep  
disturbances, and vaginal dryness. A symptom diary or questionnaire may be used to track symptoms over time.

Treatment options

- Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): HRT is one of the primary treatment options for managing perimenopausal symptoms, including depression and anxiety. It involves the administration of oestrogen and sometimes progesterone to alleviate hormonal imbalances and associated symptoms. However, it's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits of HRT with a healthcare professional, as it may not be suitable for everyone.  
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours associated with depression and anxiety. It has been shown to be effective in treating perimenopausal mood disorders and can be accessed through the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.  
- Lifestyle Modifications: Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, getting an adequate amount of sleep, and practicing stress- reduction techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises can help alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety during perimenopause. Additionally, support groups and counselling services can provide valuable emotional support and coping strategies.

NICE Guidelines  

- Fluctuating oestrogen levels have been shown to contribute to the  development of depressive symptoms and low mood during the  perimenopause. Stabilising oestrogen levels with HRT has been shown to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate depressive symptoms.  
- The NICE guidelines: HRT should be considered as a treatment for low mood  that arises as a result of the menopause.  
- Only if the patient is experiencing severe major depressive episodes should  the use of anti-depressants be considered; selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  
- HRT, preferably transdermal estradiol (gel or patch) should be offered as the  first-line treatment to women with mild perimenopausal depressive  symptoms.

Acknowledge and Address perimenopausal symptoms  
- Lifestyle measures and/or hormone replacement  therapy (HRT) alongside relevant
- Refer for CBT/Mindfulness  
- Aim for a better well-being and physical and mental  health outcomes for patients with severe mental illness.  
- Follow up with patient – GP/Therapist



Psychotherapy – cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)  
- Cognitive therapy is based on the concept that habitual negative thinking patterns leave patients vulnerable to depression in response to specific situations.  
- Therefore, the patient is taught to challenge the beliefs and assumptions that contribute to depression.  
- Over time, cognitive therapy has evolved to include behavioural elements; it is now known as ‘cognitive-behavioural therapy.’  
- Interventions : identify and challenge automatic thoughts, engage in  activities that provide evidence to disprove dysfunctional beliefs, modify core beliefs by reviewing evidence

Psychotherapy – mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)  
- ‘Mindfulness’ describes a greater awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  
- Mindfulness techniques are a way of connecting with thoughts and feelings, in order that a person can change the way they react to them.  
- MBCT has been studied in randomised controlled trials, compared against ‘treatment as usual’, which showed that treatment with MBCT reduced the risk of depressive relapse

Antidepressants (Only in more severe cases – MDD)  
- Antidepressants are the main pharmacological agents used in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  
- Several classes of antidepressant are available;  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are  generally the most commonly prescribed.  
- A patient requiring an antidepressant for a first major  depressive episode will generally receive  monotherapy

- A patient requiring an antidepressant for a first major depressive episode will generally receive  monotherapy

- The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are thought to restore the levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft by binding at the serotonin re-uptake transporter preventing the re-uptake and subsequent  degradation of serotonin.  
- This re-uptake blockade leads to the accumulation of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and the concentration of serotonin returns to within the normal range.  
- This action of SSRIs is thought to contribute to the alleviation of the symptoms of depression


# Tuberculosis
• An infectious disease that affects the lungs  
• Caused by bacteria – Mycobacterium Tuberculosis  
• Can be fatal if not treated properly
# Someones On Payroll To...Look
### Epidemiology
• Worldwide disease – ¼ of the global population has been infected by TB  
• 1.3 million people died from TB in 2022  
• 10.6 million people contracted the disease  
• Largest number of new cases occurred in South-East Asia (46%), Africa ( 23%) and Western Pacific (18%)

### Risk Factors  
- Overcrowding  
- Migration of people  
- Diabetes  
- Weakened Immune system  
- Tobacco use  
- Malnourished  
- Alcoholism

### Mode of Transmission  
- Spreads when an infected person talks/ coughs/ sneezes/shouts etc  
- Inhalation of droplets  
- Another person breathes in the bacteria  
- Spread via airborne particles called droplet nuclei  
- Transmission occurs when droplet nuclei are inhaled and reach the alveoli of the lungs, via nasal passages, respiratory tract, and bronchi

### Pathogenesis  
Droplet nuclei containing tubercle bacilli are inhaled, enter the lungs, and travel to the  
alveoli. Tubercle bacilli multiply in alveoli

A small number of tubercle bacilli enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. The tubercle bacilli may reach any part of the body

A small number of tubercle bacilli enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. The tubercle bacilli may reach any part of the body

Immunocompetent host –Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell, called a granuloma, that keeps the bacilli contained and under control (LTBI).

If the immune system cannot keep the tubercle bacilli under control, the bacilli begin to multiply rapidly (TB disease). This process can occur in different areas in the body

If the immune system cannot keep the tubercle bacilli under control, the bacilli begin to multiply rapidly (TB disease). This process can occur in different areas in the body

### Inside the body  
• Breathe in infected air and bacilli go to lungs through  
bronchioles  
• Bacilli infect alveoli  
• Macrophages attack bacteria, but some survive  
• Infected macrophages separate and form tubercles  
• Dead cells form granulomas

### Microbiology  
1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
2. Aerobic  
3. Non-spore forming ,non-motile  
4. Rod 2—5 mm long  
5. Resistant to disinfectant  
6. Once stained it resists de-colorization with acid and  
alcohol facultative intracellular organism  
7. Human is the main reservoir of MTB

### Active Vs Latent Infection  
• “Unhealthy” person  
• 1) Bacilli overwhelm immune system  
• 2) Bacilli break out of tubercles in alveoli and spread through  
bloodstream  
• 3) This is (active) TB  
• Healthy person  
1) Initial infection controlled by immune system  
2) Bacilli remain confined in tubercles for years  
3) This is(latent) TB

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis  
Primary: the lung is the First organ involved  
Asymptomatic  
Heals spontaneously  
CXR normal  
Result from endogenous reactivation of latent infection  
Symptoms include - Fever and night sweat - Weight loss - Cough...  
non-productive then productive  
HIV patients are more likely to develop active TB because HIV destroys  
T-cells. -In the west every HIV patient is tested for TB

### Tuberculous lymphadenitis  
Localized painless swelling  
Early disease: glands are discrete  
Late disease: glands are matted  
Initially, lymph nodes are discrete then as disease progresses and  
caseation increases they will become matted.  
The best samples of lymph nodes are excisional so choose the largest  
one (lymph node should be 1 cm +).  
After Excision lymph nodes should be dipped in saline only and not  
formalin because formalin may kill the organisms in tissue.

### Pleural TB  
Result from penetration by few bacilli into the pleural space  
- Pleural effusion and fever

### Spinal TB  
• Dorsal site is most common site  
• Involve two vertebral bodies and destroy the disc in between  
• In Advanced disease Collapse fracture of the bodies

### Tuberculosis Meningitis  
• Mostly affects children and may affect some adults  
• Source: – Blood spread – Rupture of a sub-ependymal tubercle  
• Symptoms: – fever – headache – neck rigidity  
• Disease typically evolves in 2 wks.  
• In children Asymptomatic state may cause miliary tuberculosis and TB  
meningitis

### TB and AIDS/HIV  
- People with active TB are more likely to have HIV than the general  
population  
- TB can appear at any stage of HIV infection  
- Early: Typical pattern of upper lobe infiltrate  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] can be difficult

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]]  
1. Medical History  
• Symptoms of pulmonary TB:  
o Prolonged cough (3 weeks or longer)  
o Chest pain  
o Loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss  
o Night sweats, fever  
o Fatigue  
2. Physical Exam  
3. Test for TB  
4. Chest Xray  
5. Microbiological testing

• When a patient presents with respiratory symptoms first line of  
diagnostics is often a chest x-ray
At least three consecutive sputum specimens  
• Each collected in 8 to 24 hour intervals  
• At least one being an early morning specimen  
• Collection from: coughing, induced sputum, bronchoscopy, gastric  
aspiration  
• Other clinical specimens: urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, pus, or  
biopsy specimens
Detection of acid-fast bacilli in stained and acid-washed smears  
examined microscopically may provide the first bacteriologic evidence of  
the presence of mycobacteria in a clinical specimen.  
Culture remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of TB  
disease, and growing bacteria are required to perform drug susceptibility  
testing
Currently, there are two methods available for the detection of M.  
tuberculosis infection:  
• Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST)  
• Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)



#### Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain  
• Mycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their  
cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary  
methods such as a Gram Stain.

![](https://i.imgur.com/948oRyk.png)


#### Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)  
• Intradermal injection of 0,1 ml of PPD  
• Volar surface of the forearm  
• Creating a discrete, pale elevation of the skin
• Read 48 to 72 hours after the injection  
• Palpating the site of injection find an area  
of induration  
Record size of induration in mm
![](https://i.imgur.com/owBuCcS.png)

#### Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):  
IGRAs detect TB infection by measuring the release of  
interferon-gamma (IFN-g) from patient T cells after stimulation  
of a whole blood sample with highly specific TB antigens

#### QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Procedure  
1. Collect whole blood in a standard blood collection tube, or  
specialized QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes.  
2. Incubate for 16 to 24 hours at 37°C.  
3. Detect released IFNγ in harvested plasma by ELISA.  
4. Analyse results using QFT-Plus Analysis Software.

#### TST Vs IGRA

### Treatment  
Major goals of treatment:  
• Cure the individual patient;  
• Minimize risk of death and disability;  
• Reduce transmission of M. tuberculosis to other people

#### First Line  
• Isoniazid (H/Inh)  
• Rifampicin (R/Rif)  
• Pyrazinamide (Z/Pza)  
• Ethambutol(E/Emb)  
• Streptomycin (S/Stm)

#### Second Line  
• Amikacin (Amk),  
kanamycin (KM)  
• Para-aminosalicylic acid  
(Pas)  
• Fluoroquinolones  
• Cycloserine (Dcs)  
• Thionamide

#### Treatment of LTBI

#### Directly Observed Therapy
DOT helps ensure patients adhere to therapy.  
• A trained health-care worker watches a patient swallow  
each dose of anti-TB drugs and documents it.  
• DOT can reduce the development of drug resistance,  
treatment failure, or relapse after the end of treatment.

#### BCG Vaccine  
• Vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) strain of M.bovis  
• Early version was first given to humans in 1921  
• Many TB-prevalent countries vaccinate infants to prevent severe  
TB disease

### Case Study  
 A 22-year-old female patient named Sarah presented to her GP. Sarah reports a  
cough that has been present for more than three weeks, and she has noticed a  
significant weight loss of approximately 5 kg in the last month. Sarah also noted she  
experiences night sweats occasionally, disrupting her sleep. She has no significant  
medical history or previous lung-related illnesses. The following diagnostic tests were  
carried out: Chest X-ray, Sputum Culture and Smear Test and Tuberculin Skin Test  
(TST). The results show; Chest X-ray: Infiltrates and cavitations in the upper lobe of  
the right lung, consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum Culture and Smear  
Test: Positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), confirming the presence of Mycobacterium  
tuberculosis. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): A 15 mm induration is observed, indicating a  
strong immune response to TB
Sarah is diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB), based on her clinical  
symptoms, positive sputum smear for AFB, chest X-ray findings, and a positive  
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST). Treatment: Sarah will undergo a standard anti-  
tuberculosis treatment regimen, which involves a combination of antibiotics for a  
duration of six months. The initial phase may include four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin,  
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for the first two months, followed by a continuation  
phase with isoniazid and rifampin for the next four months. Regular monitoring of  
symptoms, sputum cultures, and liver function will be conducted to assess  
treatment response and prevent potential side effects. Contact tracing will also be  
initiated to identify and test individuals who may have been in close contact with  
Sarah to prevent further transmission.

- Characteristics of disease that appear suddenly and persist only for a short period of time.   
Example: Flu is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses  
#### Aetiology  
- The cause of a disease – how a disease develops.  
Example: The aetiology of type 2 diabetes involves a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, primarily obesity, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.  
#### Chronic  
- Diseases that persist for a long period of time, or that recur constantly.

fluid balance.  
#### Idiopathic  
- A disease or condition for which the cause is unknown. While the mechanisms of the disease may be understood.  
Example: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an idiopathic autoimmune disease.  
#### Latency

Example: leukaemia (cancer of blood-forming tissue)  
#### Pathogenesis  
- The process by which a disease develops.  
Example: The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) involves damage to the inner lining of arteries followed by inflammation, accumulation of cholesterol and other fatty substances, and the formation of plaques that narrow the arteries.  
#### Pathology  
- The study of disease, including its causes, mechanisms, and effects on the body.  
Example: A pathologist examines a biopsy of lung tissue to diagnose lung cancer.  
#### Pathophysiology  
- The study of the functional changes associated with disease. It focuses on how disease disrupts normal physiological processes.  
Example: The pathophysiology of heart failure involves the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other tissues, shortness of breath, and fatigue  
#### Precipitating Factors  
- Factors that directly trigger the onset or worsening of a disease or condition.  
Example: Exposure to allergens triggering an asthma attack.
