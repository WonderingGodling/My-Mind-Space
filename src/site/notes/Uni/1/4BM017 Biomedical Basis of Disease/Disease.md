## Week 4 [[#Alzheimer’s Disease]]

### Pathogenesis Of Alzheimers
The pathogenesis of [[#AD]] involves progressive brain cell damage caused by abnormal protein build-up.  
1. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)  
	- Beta-amyloid proteins clump together outside brain cells due to abnormal cleavage of [[#APP]] by beta-secretase & gamma-secretase  
	- These plaques disrupt communication between neurons and trigger inflammation.  
	- Major hallmark of [[#AD]].  
	- Exact cause still unknown

2. Tau Tangles (Intracellular)  
	- Tau proteins, which normally stabilise brain cell structures, become abnormal.  
	- They form tangles inside neurons, blocking nutrient transport and leading to cell death.

3. Neuroinflammation & Cell Death  
	- The immune system reacts to plaques and tangles, causing  [[#Chronic]] inflammation.  
	- Brain cells (neurons) die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline.  
4. Brain Shrinkage (Atrophy)  
	- Over time, widespread neuron loss causes the brain to shrink, especially in the hippocampus (memory centre).

###  [[#Symptoms]]
- Memory loss
- Difficulty finding words and speaking
- Confusion about time, place, and people
- misplacing items
- inability to find steps
- poor judgment/decision-making
- personality/behaviour changes
- difficulty completing familiar tasks
- loss of ability to recognise loved ones

### Risk Factors of [[#Alzheimer’s Disease]]
1. Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease  increases significantly with age, especially after 65.  
2. Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease increases your risk of developing the disease.  
3. Genetics: Certain genetic variations, such as the APOE ε4 allele, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
4. Cardiovascular  [[#Health]]: Conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, un [[#Health]]y diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

### [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]]
1. Medical History & Physical Examination
	- Review of  [[#Symptoms]], family history, and lifestyle.  
	- Assessment of overall  [[#Health]], medications, and past illnesses.  
2. Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests  
	- [[#MMSE]] – Assesses memory, orientation, and problem- solving skills.  
	- [[#MoCA]] – Detects mild cognitive impairment.  
	- Clock Drawing Test – Evaluates visuospatial and executive function
3. Laboratory Tests  
	- Genetic testing – APOE-ε4 gene testing may be done for hereditary risk.  
4. Brain Imaging  
	- MRI or CT Scan – Detects brain shrinkage.  
	- PET Scan – Identifies amyloid plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s.
5. [[#CSF]] Analysis (in some cases)  
	- Measures levels of amyloid and tau proteins linked to [[#AD]]

| Category | Effects |
|:--------:|:-------:|
|      Amyloid Plaques    |   Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) → disrupts neuronal communication & triggers immune response      |
|    Tau Tangles      |   Hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules → forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) → disrupts intracellular transport → neuronal dysfunction & apoptosis.      |
|     Neuroinflammation     | Microglial activation fails to clear plaques → releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) →  [[#Chronic]] inflammation causes neuronal damage        |
|    Oxidative Stress & Mitochondrial Dysfunction      | Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired mitochondrial function → reduced ATP production, energy failure, and neuronal apoptosis        |
|   Neurotransmitter Deficiency       | Loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain → decreased acetylcholine (ACh) → impaired memory and learning. Glutamate dysregulation causes excitotoxicity, further damaging neurons        |
|     Synaptic & Neuronal Loss     |Progressive synapse loss & brain atrophy (hippocampus & cortex) → cognitive decline, impaired motor function, and eventual loss of vital functions.         |


### Treatment & Management Strategies
#### Medications
##### Cholinesterase inhibitors  
![](https://i.imgur.com/99hYGII.png)
- Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that encodes and recalls memories in the hippocampus.  
- Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter.  
 - Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors combat the decreased levels of acetylcholine from [[#AD]].  
- These medications prevent acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine

##### Memantine  
- Works by regulating the neurotransmitter glutamate
- Memantine helps improve cognitive function 
- Binds to NMDA  [[#Receptor]]s, which are involved in glutamate signalling.  
- Blocking these  [[#Receptor]]s, helps to reduce the overstimulation of glutamate and protect nerve cells from further damage.

##### Aducanumab and Lecanemab  
Recently approved  for early-stage [[#AD]] monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaques in the brain to slow down cognitive declin

#### Non-pharmacological approaches  
- [[#Cognitive stimulation therapy]] 
- [[#Reminiscence therapy]]  
- [[#Behavioural therapies]]  
- [[#Lifestyle modifications]]  

## Week 5 Cancer
More than 200 different types of [[#Cancer]]
All [[#Cancer]]s exhibit unregulated [[#cell proliferation]], and if left unchecked, [[#metastasis]]
[[#Cancer]] arises from the accumulation of genetic of [[#Mutation]]s and chromosome defects
Together, they lead to altered gene expression
### Causes of Mutations
#### Spontaneous mutations
- [[#Mutation]]s due to error in replication ofDNA
- Errors introduced during DNA repair
![](https://i.imgur.com/bl2JnZ2.png)
#### Induced mutations
[[#Mutation]]s arise after exposure to [[#Mutagens]]
### How many mutations are cancerous
Six and ten [[#Mutation]]s are needed for a cell to become  [[#Cancer]]ous  
- Minimum burden of [[#Mutation]]s varies according to tumour site
### Categories of Cancer Genes
There are two main categories of genes that influence [[#Cancer]]:
1. [[#Tumor suppressor genes]]
2. [[#Proto-Oncogenes]]
### Types of Cancer
![](https://i.imgur.com/92ZSHfG.png)
1. Sporadic [[#Cancer]] (70-80%):
- Random occurrence
- Environmental factors
- No genetic predisposition
1. Familial [[#Cancer]] (15-20%):
- Family history pattern
- Combination of genetics and environment
- Multiple family members affected
- No specific gene [[#Mutation]] identified
1. Hereditary [[#Cancer]] (5-10%):
- Specific gene [[#Mutation]]s (e.g., BRCA1/2)
- Earlier age of onset
- Predictable inheritance pattern
#### Breast Cancer
- Most common [[#Cancer]] in women
- 1 in 8 lifetime risk
- Early detection possible through screening
- High survival rate when caught early
#### Ovarian Cancer:
- Less common but more aggressive
- 1 in 70 lifetime risk
- Limited early detection methods
- Lower survival rates due to late diagnosis
#### Hereditary Link:
- BRCA1/2 [[#Mutation]]s increase risk for both
- Often co-occur in families
- Known as hereditary breast and ovarian [[#Atherosclerosis]] (HBOC)
- Require comprehensive management strategy
### Breast [[#Atherosclerosis]] Diagnosis
Clinical Breast Exams Women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam every 3 years. After age 40, women should have a breast exam every year 
#### Diagnostic Tests and Procedures
##### Blood Tests:
- Complete blood count (CBC)
- Overall health assessment
##### Mammography:
- X-ray screening of breast tissue
- Detects pre-symptomatic tumours
- Identifies microcalcifications
- Further imaging if abnormalities found
##### Breast Ultrasound
- Uses sound waves for imaging
- Differentiates solid masses vs. fluid cysts
- Guides biopsy procedures
##### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):
- Magnetic field imaging technology
- Contrast dye enhancement
- Key uses:
- Precise tumour location
- Multiple tumour detection
- Dense tissue examination
- Non-radiation based
##### Biopsy Process:
- Definitive diagnostic procedure
- Needle-guided tissue sampling
- Image-guided precision (X-ray/ultrasound)
- Metal marker placement for reference
##### Tissue Analysis:
- [[#Atherosclerosis]] cell detection
- Tumour classification
- Grade assessment
- Hormone receptor status
- Treatment-determining factors
##### Immunohistochemistry
- Laboratory test performed on breast [[#Cancer]] cells
- Identifies specific proteins and markers including:
1. Oestrogen receptors
2. Progesterone receptors
3. HER2 status
4. Ki-67 proliferation marker
5. Results guide treatment decisions
### Breast Cancer Genetics
#### High Risk (>50% lifetime risk):
- BRCA1 [[#Mutation]]: 50-70% risk by age 70
- BRCA2 [[#Mutation]]: 40-60% risk by age 70
- Affects both breast and ovarian [[#Cancer]] risk
- Requires intensive screening and monitoring
#### Moderate to High Risk
(25-50%+):
- Risk varies based on specific [[#Mutation]]s
- Family history impacts risk level
- May require different management strategies
- Regular screening essential
- Breast [[#Cancer]] Genetics
### What is the purpose of our normal BRCA genes?
- Encodes proteins that regulate DNA repair
- Acts as tumour suppressor by preventing uncontrolled cell division
- Protects cellular DNA from carcinogenic damage and [[#Mutation]]s
- Maintains DNA integrity through repair mechanisms
#### BRCA Mutation Effects:
- Compromised DNA repair capability
- Reduced tumour suppression function
- Increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian malignancies
### Genetic Testing
#### Benefits
- Allows for individualized medical management
- Accurate risk assessment
- Alleviates uncertainty and anxiety
#### Limitations
Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 does not identify all causes of hereditary breast or ovarian [[#Cancer]]
### Managing Hereditary Cancer
- Surveillance
- Chemoprevention
- Prophylactic surgery
- Individual risk reduction may vary based on personal health history


## Week 6  [[#Cardiovascular Disease]]

### Coronary Circulation  
The heart gets blood through coronary arteries (from aorta)
If flow is reduced you get [[#Angina Pectoris]] and if it stops you get [[#Myocardial Infarction]]
[[#Atherosclerosis]] in coronary arteries reduces flow

#### 3 pathologic stages  
1. [[#The fatty streak]]  
	- No  [[#Symptoms]]  
2. [[#Plaque progression]]  
	- [[#Angina Pectoris]]
3. Plaque disruption
	- [[#myocardial infarction]]

##### The fatty streak  
- Endothelial injury – leads to its dysfunction  
- Physical stressors (E.g. high BP)  
- Chemical stressors  (E.g. smoking or high cholesterol)  

<center> Excess LDL cholesterol accumulates under endothelium.  </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> LDL is modified by oxidation and phagocytosed, forming foam cells. </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> The macrophages produce paracrines that attract smooth muscle cells. </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> This forms the lesion or ‘fatty streak’ </center>

##### Plaque Progression  
<center>Fibrous scar tissue surrounds lipid core  </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> Initial growth is outward which preserves diameter of lumen therefore no down flow  </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> Smooth muscle cells migrate from media to the intima, proliferate and produce extracellular matrix  </center>
<center> ↓ </center>
<center> Thickened arterial wall narrows the lumen which restricts flow causing ischaemia </center>


### Stable vs Unstable Angina

|   Stable angina  |  Unstable angina   |
| --- | --- |
| Occurs on exertion    |  Can occur at rest   |
| Caused by an increase in myocardial O2 demand| Caused by a reduced O2 supply| 
| Demand exceeds available supply| Higher frequency, intensity and duration of ischaemic episodes|
|      | More likely to progress to [[#myocardial infarction]]|




Both cause [[#myocardial ischaemia]]

### [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]]  
#### Electrocardiogram    
ST segment depression Due to [[#myocardial ischaemia]]  
His [[#ECG]] showed some  [[#Signs]] of [[#myocardial ischaemia]], but no permanent cardiac damage.

#### Stress testing -  exercise  
- Exercise on treadmill or cycle ergometer  
- HR, BP & [[#ECG]] monitored  
- Aim for 85% of max HR  
- Positive test  
	- Angina pain develops  
	- Ischaemic  [[#Signs]] on [[#ECG]]  
		- ‘ST depression’  
	- STOP test!
##### Pharmacological and nuclear imaging
- Inject a coronary vasodilator  
	- Ischaemic regions already  maximally vasodilated so as other regions dilate they steal blood from the diseased areas  
	- Areas that are poorly perfused do  not get as much of the radionucleotide which is injected –  look like a ‘cold spot’ on the image  
- Inject a sympathomimetic  
	- Activates adrenergic  [[#Receptor]]s  
	- Increase force of contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy) – mimics exercise  

### Risk Factors for Developing CAD - [[#Aetiology|aetiology]]  

|High levels of LDL| Low levels of HDL|
|----|----|
|Carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body| Transports cholesterol away from peripheral tissues back to liver for removal|
|Excess cholesterol  accumulates in vessel wall| hdl is Antioxidative|
|High fat diet and genetic predisposition Cause This| Lack of exercise, Excess alcohol, and Smoking cause this|

#### Smoking  
More Than 1 pack a day increases the death rate from ischaemic heart disease by 200% through
-  modification of LDL  
- Endothelial dysfunction  
- platelet adhesiveness  
- Activation of sympathetic NS  
#### Obesity  
In the UK 1 in 6 deaths due to CVD are associated with a high body-mass index
#### High blood pressure  
5 x greater risk of IHD if BP >165/95 mmHg caused by
-  wall stress – endothelial damage  
-  foam cell formation  
-  retention of LDL in vessel wall  

#### Diabetes Mellitus  
- Adults with diabetes are more 2-3 times more likely to develop  
 [[#Cardiovascular Disease]] and People with diabetes are twice as likely to die from heart disease because of
-  modification of LDL for macrophage uptake by High  [[#Glucose]]
-  foam cell formation  
- More prone to thrombosis  
- Endothelial dysfunction from damage by high blood  [[#Glucose]]

### Treatment of CAD  
Treatment aims to:  
- Reduce disease progression  
- Improve myocardial blood flow (oxygen supply)  
- Reduce myocardial work (oxygen demand)  
- Match supply and demand

#### Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)  
Formation of nitric oxide  
- Vascular smooth muscle relaxation  
- Causes dilation of arteries and veins  
- Reduces preload (myocardial O2 demand)  
- Dilate coronary vasculature   
- Incraese myocardial O2 supply

#### Preventative Treatment: Reduce risk factors  
- Angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors 
- Enhances vasodilation and diuresis  
- Beta adrenergic  [[#Receptor]]s 
- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins)  
- Lower cholesterol levels  

#### Surgical intervention: Angioplasty
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
- Blockage >50%  
- No response to other  treatment  
- Several arteries affected  
##### Method  
- Use a ‘spare’ vessel (E.g. Saphenous (leg) vein)  
- Internal mammary artery  


## week 7 Mental  [[#Health]]
During [[#Perimenopause]], hormonal fluctuations occur, leading to various physical and emotional  [[#Symptoms]] such as irregular periods, hot flashes and mood swings.  

### Mental  [[#Health]] Disorders  
#### Anxiety disorders:  
Patients respond to certain objects or situations or objects with fear and dread.  
Feeling of unease, worry.  
Show physical  [[#Signs]] of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating.  
Diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the  
person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal  
functioning.  
Examples: generalised anxiety disorder; panic disorder; social anxiety disorder,  
and phobias.  

#### Mood disorders: 
Involve persistent feelings of sadness or fluctuations from extreme elation to  
extreme sadness. Physical  [[#Symptoms]] include sleep disturbance, fatigue.  
Examples: depression, bipolar disorder.

#### Depresssion  
Patients with a pre-existing major depressive disorder – prior to [[#Perimenopause]], are at  
risk of relapse in the perimenopausal period and may find that anti-depressants that  
they may have been previously prescribed are perhaps no longer effective, or that a  
much higher  [[#Dose]] is required to have the same effect.  

#### Anxiety  
Anxiety  [[#Symptoms]] are often a hallmark of [[#Perimenopause]] and are more likely to occur in those with a pre-existing [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] or sensitivity towards anxiety.  
Anxiety  [[#Symptoms]] are strongly linked to vasomotor  [[#Symptoms]] (hot flashes), with anxiety  [[#Symptoms]] preceding the onset of vasomotor  [[#Symptoms]].  

### Risk factors;  
Women with a history of premenstrual  [[#Syndrome]] and postnatal depression are at a  
particular risk Pre-existing depression/anxiety prior to [[#Perimenopause]];

#### Anxiety in Depression (in general)  
- Anxiety is common in the context of depression.  
- Anxiety  [[#Symptoms]] often appear 1 year or 2 years ahead of the onset of major depression, and with increasing age, become a more pronounced feature of major depressive episodes.  
- High levels of anxiety are associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness and greater likelihood of non-response to treatment
- Approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental  [[#Health]] problem each year.  
- In England, 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental  [[#Health]] problem (such as anxiety and depression) in any given week  
- 1 in 100 women will experience depression during [[#Perimenopause]]/[[#menopause]]  
- Most women (8 out of 10) experience some  [[#Symptoms]], typically lasting about 4 years after the last period, but continuing for up to 12 years in about 10% of women.

###  [[#Symptoms]]
![](https://i.imgur.com/XmiYmOP.png)

#### Mechanisms of disease
- Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in Oestrogen and progesterone levels during [[#Perimenopause]] are believed to play a significant role in the development of mood disturbances. Oestrogen has known effects on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, which are involved in mood regulation. Changes in hormone levels can disrupt the delicate balance of these neurotransmitters, contributing to  [[#Symptoms]] of depression and anxiety.  
- Neuroendocrine Dysregulation: The hormonal changes associated with [[#Perimenopause]] can also impact the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key neuroendocrine system involved in the body's stress response. Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, including depression and anxiety.  
- Neurotransmitter Imbalance: In addition to Oestrogen, other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, may also be dysregulated during [[#Perimenopause]], contributing to mood disturbances. Changes in the levels or activity of these neurotransmitters can affect emotional processing and mood regulation.  
- Genetic Predisposition: Genetic factors may predispose some individuals to develop depression and anxiety during [[#Perimenopause]]. Family history of mood disorders can increase the risk of experiencing similar  [[#Symptoms]] during the menopausal transition.

#### Monoamine neurotransmitters  
Serotonin helps regulate sleep, appetite, and mood and inhibits pain. It is thought to play a role in motor, cognitive, and autonomic functions. Some depressed people have reduced serotonin levels. Noradrenaline constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure. It also seems to help determine motivation and reward. It may trigger anxiety and be involved in some types of depression. Dopamine is essential to movement. It also influences motivation and plays a role in how a person perceives reality. Also plays a role in cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviours.

- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological  [[#Symptoms]].  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the [[#Perimenopause]] and [[#menopause]], destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the [[#menopause]] and thought to be linked to changes in mood.  

#### Fluctuating Hormones
- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological  [[#Symptoms]].  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the  neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the [[#Perimenopause]] and [[#menopause]], destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the [[#menopause]] and thought to be linked to changes in mood

##### Affects of reducing levels of Oestrogen
- Hormonal fluctuations : changes in oestrogen, play a significant role in mood regulation.  
- Oestrogen, in particular, has an impact on serotonin and other neurotransmitters associated with mood.  
- Fluctuations in these hormones can disrupt the delicate balance, disruption of leading to mood disturbances.

##### Affects of reducing levels of Testosterone;  
- In addition to oestrogen, total and free testosterone levels decline with age, often beginning in the mid reproductive years.  
- There is evidence that transdermal testosterone therapy gives a meaningful improvement in psychological well-being as well as in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder.  

##### Affects of reducing levels of Progesterone;  
- Progesterone  [[#Receptor]]s are also found within the brain, and reduced levels of progesterone, although not seen to have a consistent impact on psychological well-being, can have an impact on menopausal symptomology which would otherwise lead to an increase in psychological distress.

#### Hypothalamic–Pituitary–adrenal axis changes in depression  
- One of the most consistent biological findings in more severe depression with melancholic features, and associated with changes in the HPA axis, is the increased amount of plasma cortisol.  
- This is caused by a combination of excessive stress related cortisol release and impaired glucocorticoid  [[#Receptor]]- mediated feedback inhibition.  
- Notably, HPA axis changes are also associated with impaired cognitive function and a failure of HPA axis  normalisation with treatment is associated with poor clinical response and high relapse.

### [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[#Perimenopause]]
In the UK, the [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] of [[#Perimenopause]] is typically based on clinical evaluation and assessment of  [[#Symptoms]], as well as consideration of a woman's age and menstrual history:  
Medical History: Require a detailed medical history, including information about menstrual patterns,  [[#Symptoms]] experienced i.e. PMS/PND, and any relevant medical conditions or medications. It's important for women to provide accurate information about their  [[#Symptoms]] and menstrual cycles, including the regularity and duration of periods.  
Physical Examination: A physical examination may be conducted to assess overall  [[#Health]] and to rule out other conditions, this is not required if [[#Perimenopause]] is suspected.  
Laboratory Tests: No specific test to definitively diagnose [[#Perimenopause]]. May need to rule out other underlying conditions.  
Symptom Assessment: Evaluate the presence and severity of  [[#Symptoms]] commonly  
associated with [[#Perimenopause]], such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, sleep  
disturbances, and vaginal dryness. A symptom diary or questionnaire may be used to track  [[#Symptoms]] over time.

#### [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] of perimenopausal depression

##### Treatment options

- Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): HRT is one of the primary treatment options for managing perimenopausal  [[#Symptoms]], including depression and anxiety. It involves the administration of oestrogen and sometimes progesterone to alleviate hormonal imbalances and associated  [[#Symptoms]]. However, it's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits of HRT with a  [[#Health]]care professional, as it may not be suitable for everyone.  
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: [[#CBT]] is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours associated with depression and anxiety. It has been shown to be effective in treating perimenopausal mood disorders and can be accessed through the National  [[#Health]] Service (NHS) in the UK.  
- [[#Lifestyle modifications]]: Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a  [[#Health]]y diet, getting an adequate amount of sleep, and practicing stress- reduction techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises can help alleviate  [[#Symptoms]] of depression and anxiety during [[#Perimenopause]]. Additionally, support groups and counselling services can provide valuable emotional support and coping strategies.

##### NICE Guidelines  

- Fluctuating oestrogen levels have been shown to contribute to the  development of depressive  [[#Symptoms]] and low mood during the  [[#Perimenopause]]. Stabilising oestrogen levels with HRT has been shown to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate depressive  [[#Symptoms]].  
- The NICE guidelines: HRT should be considered as a treatment for low mood  that arises as a result of the [[#menopause]].  
- Only if the patient is experiencing severe major depressive episodes should  the use of anti-depressants be considered; selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors ([[#SSRIs]]) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  
- HRT, preferably transdermal estradiol (gel or patch) should be offered as the  first-line treatment to women with mild perimenopausal depressive   [[#Symptoms]].

##### Acknowledge and Address perimenopausal  [[#Symptoms]]  
- Lifestyle measures and/or hormone replacement  therapy (HRT) alongside relevant
- Refer for [[#CBT]]/Mindfulness  
- Aim for a better well-being and physical and mental   [[#Health]] outcomes for patients with severe mental illness.  
- Follow up with patient – GP/Therapist

##### Psychotherapy – [[#CBT]]  
- Cognitive therapy is based on the concept that habitual negative thinking patterns leave patients vulnerable to depression in response to specific situations.  
- Therefore, the patient is taught to challenge the beliefs and assumptions that contribute to depression.  
- Over time, cognitive therapy has evolved to include behavioural elements; it is now known as ‘cognitive-behavioural therapy.’  
- Interventions : identify and challenge automatic thoughts, engage in  activities that provide evidence to disprove dysfunctional beliefs, modify core beliefs by reviewing evidence

##### Psychotherapy – [[#MBCT]]
- ‘Mindfulness’ describes a greater awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  
- Mindfulness techniques are a way of connecting with thoughts and feelings, in order that a person can change the way they react to them.  
- [[#MBCT]] has been studied in randomised controlled trials, compared against ‘treatment as usual’, which showed that treatment with [[#MBCT]] reduced the risk of depressive relapse

Antidepressants (Only in more severe cases – MDD)  
- Antidepressants are the main pharmacological agents used in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  
- Several classes of antidepressant are available; [[#SSRIs]] are  generally the most commonly prescribed.  
- A patient requiring an antidepressant for a first major  depressive episode will generally receive  monotherapy

#### selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
- The [[#SSRIs]] are thought to restore the levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft by binding at the serotonin re-uptake transporter preventing the re-uptake and subsequent  degradation of serotonin.  
- This re-uptake blockade leads to the accumulation of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and the concentration of serotonin returns to within the normal range.  
- This action of [[#SSRIs]] is thought to contribute to the alleviation of the  [[#Symptoms]] of depression

## Tuberculosis
- An infectious disease that affects the lungs  
- Caused by bacteria – [[#Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]  
- Can be fatal if not treated properly

### Risk Factors  
- Overcrowding  
- Migration of people  
- Diabetes  
- Weakened Immune system  
- Tobacco use  
- Malnourished  
- Alcoholism

### Mode of Transmission  
- Spreads when an infected person talks/ coughs/ sneezes/shouts etc  
- Inhalation of droplets  
- Another person breathes in the bacteria  
- Spread via airborne particles called droplet nuclei  
- Transmission occurs when droplet nuclei are inhaled and reach the alveoli of the lungs, via nasal passages, respiratory tract, and bronchi

### Pathogenesis  
- Droplet nuclei containing tubercle bacilli are inhaled, enter the lungs, and travel to the 
- alveoli. Tubercle bacilli multiply in alveoli
- A small number of tubercle bacilli enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. The tubercle bacilli may reach any part of the body
- Immunocompetent host –Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell, called a granuloma, that keeps the bacilli contained and under control (LTBI).
- If the immune system cannot keep the tubercle bacilli under control, the bacilli begin to multiply rapidly ([[#TB]]disease). This process can occur in different areas in the body
### Inside the body  
- Breathe in infected air and bacilli go to lungs through  bronchioles  
- Bacilli infect alveoli  
- Macrophages attack bacteria, but some survive  
- Infected macrophages separate and form tubercles  
- Dead cells form granulomas

### Microbiology  
#### Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
1. Aerobic  
2. Non-spore forming ,non-motile  
3. Rod 2—5 mm long  
4. Resistant to disinfectant  
5. Once stained it resists de-colorization with acid and alcohol facultative intracellular organism  
6. Human is the main reservoir of MTB

### Active Vs Latent Infection  
“Un [[#Health]]y” person  
- Bacilli overwhelm immune system  
-  Bacilli break out of tubercles in alveoli and spread through bloodstream  
- This is (active)[[#TB]]  
 [[#Health]]y person  
- Initial infection controlled by immune system  
- Bacilli remain confined in tubercles for years  
- This is(latent)[[#TB]]

![](https://i.imgur.com/xUEargd.png)


### Pulmonary Tuberculosis  
- Primary: the lung is the First organ involved  
- Asymptomatic  
- Heals spontaneously  
- CXR normal  
- Result from  [[#Health]] reactivation of latent infection  
-  [[#Symptoms]] include - Fever and night sweat - Weight loss - Cough...  
- non-productive then productive  
- HIV patients are more likely to develop active[[#TB]] because HIV destroys  
- T-cells. -In the west every HIV patient is tested for[[#TB]]

### Tuberculous lymphadenitis  
- Localized painless swelling  
- Early disease: glands are discrete  
- Late disease: glands are matted  
- Initially, lymph nodes are discrete then as disease progresses and caseation increases they will become matted.  
- The best samples of lymph nodes are excisional so choose the largest one (lymph node should be 1 cm +).  
- After Excision lymph nodes should be dipped in saline only and not formalin because formalin may kill the organisms in tissue.
### Pleural [[#TB]]  
Result from penetration by few bacilli into the pleural space  
- Pleural effusion and fever
### Spinal [[#TB]]  
- Dorsal site is most common site  
- Involve two vertebral bodies and destroy the disc in between  
- In Advanced disease Collapse fracture of the bodies
### Tuberculosis Meningitis  
- Mostly affects children and may affect some adults  
- Source: – Blood spread – Rupture of a sub-ependymal tubercle  
-  [[#Symptoms]]: – fever – headache – neck rigidity  
- Disease typically evolves in 2 wks.  
- In children Asymptomatic state may cause miliary tuberculosis and[[#TB]] meningitis

### [[#TB]] and AIDS/HIV  
- People with active[[#TB]] are more likely to have HIV than the general population  
-[[#TB]] can appear at any stage of HIV infection  
- Early: Typical pattern of upper lobe infiltrate  
- [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]] can be difficult

![](https://i.imgur.com/Mm0xncq.png)


### [[#Diagnosis|diagnosis]]  
1. Medical History  
	- Prolonged cough (3 weeks or longer)  
	-  Chest pain  
	-  Loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss  
	- Night sweats, fever  
	- Fatigue  
2. Physical Exam  
3. Test for[[#TB]]  
4. Chest Xray  
5. Microbiological testing
	- When a patient presents with respiratory  [[#Symptoms]] first line of  diagnostics is often a chest x-ray
	- At least three consecutive sputum specimens  
	- Each collected in 8 to 24 hour intervals  
	- At least one being an early morning specimen  
	- Collection from: coughing, induced sputum, bronchoscopy, gastric aspiration  
	- Other clinical specimens: urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, pus, or biopsy specimens

#### Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain  
- Mycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods such as a Gram Stain.
Detection of acid-fast bacilli in stained and acid-washed smears examined microscopically may provide the first bacteriologic evidence of the presence of mycobacteria in a clinical specimen. Culture remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of [[#TB]] disease, and growing bacteria are required to perform  [[#Drug]] susceptibility testing
Currently, there are two methods available for the detection of [[#Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] infection:  
- Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST)  
- Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)

![](https://i.imgur.com/948oRyk.png)


#### Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)  
- Intradermal injection of 0,1 ml of PPD  
- Volar surface of the forearm  
- Creating a discrete, pale elevation of the skin
- Read 48 to 72 hours after the injection  
- Palpating the site of injection find an area of induration  
- Record size of induration in mm
![](https://i.imgur.com/owBuCcS.png)

#### Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):  
IGRAs detect[[#TB]] infection by measuring the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) from patient T cells after stimulation of a whole blood sample with highly specific[[#TB]] antigens

#### QuantiFERON-[[#TB]] Gold Plus Procedure  
1. Collect whole blood in a standard blood collection tube, or specialized QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes.  
2. Incubate for 16 to 24 hours at 37°C.  
3. Detect released IFNγ in harvested plasma by ELISA.  
4. Analyse results using QFT-Plus Analysis Software.

#### TST Vs IGRA

### Treatment  
Major goals of treatment:  
- Cure the individual patient;  
- Minimize risk of death and disability;  
- Reduce transmission of [[#Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] to other people

#### First Line  
- Isoniazid (H/Inh)  
- Rifampicin (R/Rif)  
- Pyrazinamide (Z/Pza)  
- Ethambutol(E/Emb)  
- Streptomycin (S/Stm)

#### Second Line  
- Amikacin (Amk), kanamycin (KM)  
- Para-aminosalicylic acid (Pas)  
- Fluoroquinolones  
- Cycloserine (Dcs)  
- Thionamide

#### Treatment of LTBI

![](https://i.imgur.com/YMauSCF.png)

#### Directly Observed Therapy
DOT helps ensure patients adhere to therapy.  
- A trained  [[#Health]]-care worker watches a patient swallow each  [[#Dose]] of anti-[[#TB]] [[#Drug]]s and documents it.  
- DOT can reduce the development of  [[#Drug]] resistance, treatment failure, or relapse after the end of treatment.

#### BCG Vaccine  
- Vaccine made from live, attenuated (weakened) strain of M.bovis  
- Early version was first given to humans in 1921  
- Many[[#TB]]-prevalent countries vaccinate infants to prevent severe[[#TB]] disease

### Case Study  
 A 22-year-old female patient named Sarah presented to her GP. Sarah reports a  
cough that has been present for more than three weeks, and she has noticed a  
significant weight loss of approximately 5 kg in the last month. Sarah also noted she  
experiences night sweats occasionally, disrupting her sleep. She has no significant  
medical history or previous lung-related illnesses. The following diagnostic tests were  
carried out: Chest X-ray, Sputum Culture and Smear Test and Tuberculin Skin Test  
(TST). The results show; Chest X-ray: Infiltrates and cavitations in the upper lobe of  
the right lung, consistent with [[#Pulmonary Tuberculosis]]. Sputum Culture and Smear  
Test: Positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), confirming the presence of Mycobacterium  
tuberculosis. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): A 15 mm induration is observed, indicating a  
strong immune response to[[#TB]]
Sarah is diagnosed with [[#Pulmonary Tuberculosis]] , based on her clinical  
 [[#Symptoms]], positive sputum smear for AFB, chest X-ray findings, and a positive  
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST). Treatment: Sarah will undergo a standard anti-  
[[#Tuberculosis]] treatment regimen, which involves a combination of antibiotics for a  
duration of six months. The initial phase may include four  [[#Drug]]s (isoniazid, rifampin,  
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for the first two months, followed by a continuation  
phase with isoniazid and rifampin for the next four months. Regular monitoring of  
 [[#Symptoms]], sputum cultures, and liver function will be conducted to assess  
treatment response and prevent potential  [[#Side Effect]]s. Contact tracing will also be  
initiated to identify and test individuals who may have been in close contact with  
Sarah to prevent further transmission.


### Terminology

The study of disease, including its causes, mechanisms, and effects on the body.  
Example: A pathologist examines a biopsy of lung tissue to diagnose lung [[#Cancer]].  
#### Pathophysiology  
The study of the functional changes associated with disease. It focuses on how disease disrupts normal physiological processes.  
Example: The  [[#Predisposing Factors]] of heart failure involves the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other tissues, shortness of breath, and fatigue  
#### Precipitating Factors

#### Toxic effect
a harmful consequence caused by a substance, whether a chemical,  [[#Drug]], or other agent, that is harmful to a living organism
#### Harmful Consequences
 [[#Toxic effect]]s are the negative impacts that a substance has on an organism. These impacts can be at the cellular level (cytotoxicity), organ level (e.g., hepatotoxicity - liver damage), or at the level of the whole organism.
#### Xenobiotic Response
 [[#Toxic effect]]s are often triggered by xenobiotic substances, meaning substances that are foreign to the body.
#### Protective Responses
While often viewed as negative, some  [[#Toxic effect]]s can be seen as protective responses by the body to eliminate the harmful substance. 
#### Acute Toxicity
These effects occur rapidly after a single or short-term exposure, and are often reversible. Examples include hangovers from alcohol consumption or  [[#Poisoning]]  [[#Symptoms]] from a single exposure to a toxic substance. 
#### Chronic Toxicity
These effects develop gradually over time, often from repeated or prolonged exposure, and can be irreversible. Examples include liver damage from long-term alcohol abuse or lung [[#Cancer]] from smoking. 
#### Local  Toxic effects
These effects occur at the site of contact or exposure, like a burn from a strong acid. 
#### Systemic  Toxic effects
These effects are widespread throughout the body, impacting multiple organs or systems. 
#### Chemical Structure
The chemical structure of a substance plays a role in its toxicity. 
#### Absorption
How readily a substance is absorbed into the body affects the potential for toxicity. The  [[#Drug]] moving into the body from an external source
#### Metabolism and Elimination
The body's ability to process and eliminate a substance also influences toxicity. 
#### Dose
The amount of substance to which an individual is exposed can significantly impact the severity of the  [[#Toxic effect]]. 
####  Drug Toxicity
Over [[#Dose]]s or adverse reactions to medications can lead to  [[#Toxic effect]]s. 
#### Environmental Toxins
Exposure to pollutants like heavy metals or certain pesticides can cause  [[#Toxic effect]]s. 
#### Poisoning
Ingestion or exposure to poisonous substances can result in severe  [[#Toxic effect]]s. 
#### Adverse Effect
A broader term encompassing any harmful, undesired outcome from a medication or other medical intervention. This could include  [[#Symptoms]],  [[#Complication]]s, or even death. 
#### Side Effect
A specific type of  [[#Adverse Effect]]. It's considered a consequence of the primary therapeutic action of a  [[#Drug]]. For example, a common side effect of an anti-inflammatory  [[#Drug]] might be stomach upset, which is a consequence of the  [[#Drug]]'s action on the body. 
#### Complication
Similar to  [[#Adverse Effect]], but may be used in situations where the negative effect is expected or common, such as with surgery. 
#### Medical Error
If the negative effect results from an unsuitable dosage or procedure, it's not considered an  [[#Adverse Effect]], but rather a  [[#Drug]].

#### Glucose
Comes from carbohydrates And is absorbed into your bloodstream, where it travels to your cells to provide them with (Their primary source Of) energy.
#### hyperglycaemia
excessive blood sugar
#### Insulin
a hormone produced by the pancreas That allows  [[#Glucose]] to enter cells (through blood), for energy.
#### Insulin Resistance
Cells Not responding to  [[#Insulin]] Through  [[#Reduced tissue sensitivity]] And  [[#Increased glucose production]]
#### Reduced tissue sensitivity
Cells in muscles, fat, and liver become less responsive to  [[#Insulin]] decreasing  [[#Glucose]] uptake and utilisation.
#### Increased  Glucose production
The liver produces more  [[#Glucose]], contributing to  [[#hyperglycaemia]]
#### Impaired  Insulin Secretion
 [[#Beta-cell dysfunction]] And  [[#Progressive decline]]
#### Beta-cell dysfunction
The pancreatic beta cells gradually lose their ability to secrete enough  [[#Insulin]] to overcome resistance.
#### Progressive decline
Cell function deteriorates worsening  [[#hyperglycaemia]]
#### Hypertension

HbA1c provides an average of blood  [[#Glucose]] over 2–3 months due to the lifespan of red blood cells being 120 days. 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. 
#### FPG Test
[[#Fasting Plasma Glucose Test]]
#### Fasting Plasma  Glucose Test
Measures blood  [[#Glucose]] after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours) to establish a baseline. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes.
#### OGTT
[[#Oral Glucose Tolerance Test]]
#### Oral  Glucose Tolerance Test
Measures blood sugar level before and 2 hours after drinking a sugary liquid (75g). A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes
#### RPG Test
[[#Random Plasma Glucose Test]]
#### Random Plasma  Glucose Test
Measures blood sugar level at any time of day. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with  [[#Symptoms]] of diabetes, indicates diabetes.
#### Metformin
Increase  [[#Insulin]] sensitivity & decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis
#### Gliclazide
Stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to release more  [[#Insulin]]
#### Sitagliptin
Enhance  [[#Insulin]] secretion and reduce glucagon secretion
#### Linagliptin
Increase incretin hormone levels, which enhance  [[#Insulin]] release and  decrease glucagon secretion
#### Polydipsia
Increased Thirst
#### Polyuria
Frequent Urination
### Polyphagia
Increased Hunger
#### AD
[[#Alzheimer’s Disease]]
#### Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes.  
#### APP
amyloid precursor protein
#### MMSE
Mini-Mental State Examination
#### MoCA
Montreal Cognitive Assessment
#### CSF
Cerebrospinal Fluid
#### Cognitive stimulation therapy  
Engaging in activities that stimulate cognitive functions, such as memory, problem-solving, and language.  
#### Reminiscence therapy  
Discussing past experiences and memories, often using prompts like photos or music, to improve mood and well-being.  
#### Behavioural therapies  
Helps manage behavioural and psychological  [[#Symptoms]] associated with Alzheimer's, such as agitation, anxiety, and depression.  
#### Lifestyle modifications  
Maintaining a  [[#Health]]y lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social engagement can also help support brain  [[#Health]] and potentially slow down the progression of Alzheimer's.
#### Angina Pectoris
Is Chest Pain, Usually: Dull, Heavy Tight Squeezing/Aching That Radiates Though The Chest, Arm Or Jaw.
Often Associated With Shortness Of Breath, Seating, Nausea and vomiting
#### ECG
[[#Electrocardiogram]]
#### Perimenopause
Refers to the transitional phase that women experience before reaching [[#menopause]] (Typically 40+). It typically begins (and lasts for) several years before [[#menopause]] as it marks the gradual decline in ovarian function and hormone production.  
#### menopause
The point when a woman stops menstruating entirely
#### CBT
cognitive-behavioural therapy
#### MBCT
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
#### SSRIs
[[#selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors]]
#### TB
Tuberculosis
#### myocardial ischaemia
Myocardial ischaemia is the consequence of an imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand in a part of the myocardium
#### Myocardial Infarction
the heart muscle is damaged or dies due to a blockage of blood flow
#### Atherosclerosis
the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls
#### Cancer
a broad spectrum of (over 200) genomic diseases that are defined by the tissue and cell type in which they originate
#### cell proliferation
cells increase in number through growth and division
#### metastasis
the spread of [[#Cancer]] from one part of the body to another
#### Polymorphism  
Polymorphism is derived from Greek and means "having multiple forms.  
Due to their high Frequency they are considered unlikely to be causative of genetic disease  
They can however, together with other genetic and environmental factors, affect disease predisposition, disease progression or response to treatments  
#### Mutation  
The changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that  
may be transmitted to subsequent generations  
Caused by the alteration of single base units in DNA, or the deletion,  
insertion, or rearrangement of larger sections of genes or chromosomes
#### Mutagens
environmental factors that result in DNA damage
#### Tumor suppressor genes
Encode proteins that restrain cell growth and prevent cells from becoming malignant
#### Proto-Oncogenes
Encoded proteins that promote cell growth control Understood as inactive oncogenes
