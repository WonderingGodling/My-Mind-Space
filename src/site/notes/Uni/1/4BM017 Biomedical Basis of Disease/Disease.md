## Week 4 [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Alzheimer’s Disease\|#Alzheimer’s Disease]]

### Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#AD\|#AD]]involves progressive brain cell damage caused by abnormal protein build-up.  
1. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)  
	- Beta-amyloid proteins clump together outside brain cells due to abnormal cleavage of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#APP\|#APP]] by beta-secretase & gamma-secretase  
	- These plaques disrupt communication between neurons and trigger inflammation.  
	- Major hallmark of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#AD\|#AD]].  
	- Exact cause still unknown

2. Tau Tangles (Intracellular)  
	- Tau proteins, which normally stabilise brain cell structures, become abnormal.  
	- They form tangles inside neurons, blocking nutrient transport and leading to cell death.

3. Neuroinflammation & Cell Death  
	- The immune system reacts to plaques and tangles, causing  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Chronic\|#Chronic]] inflammation.  
	- Brain cells (neurons) die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline.  
4. Brain Shrinkage (Atrophy)  
	- Over time, widespread neuron loss causes the brain to shrink, especially in the hippocampus (memory centre).

###  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]
- Memory loss
- Difficulty finding words and speaking
- Confusion about time, place, and people
- misplacing items
- inability to find steps
- poor judgment/decision-making
- personality/behaviour changes
- difficulty completing familiar tasks
- loss of ability to recognise loved ones

### Risk Factors of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Alzheimer’s Disease\|#Alzheimer’s Disease]]
1. Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease  increases significantly with age, especially after 65.  
2. Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease increases your risk of developing the disease.  
3. Genetics: Certain genetic variations, such as the APOE ε4 allele, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
4. Cardiovascular  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]: Conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, un [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]y diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]]
1. Medical History & Physical Examination
	- Review of  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], family history, and lifestyle.  
	- Assessment of overall  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]], medications, and past illnesses.  
2. Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests  
	- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#MMSE\|#MMSE]] – Assesses memory, orientation, and problem- solving skills.  
	- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#MoCA\|#MoCA]] – Detects mild cognitive impairment.  
	- Clock Drawing Test – Evaluates visuospatial and executive function
3. Laboratory Tests  
	- Genetic testing – APOE-ε4 gene testing may be done for hereditary risk.  
4. Brain Imaging  
	- MRI or CT Scan – Detects brain shrinkage.  
	- PET Scan – Identifies amyloid plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s.
5. [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#CSF\|#CSF]] Analysis (in some cases)  
	- Measures levels of amyloid and tau proteins linked to [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#AD\|#AD]]

| Category | Effects |
|:--------:|:-------:|
|      Amyloid Plaques    |   Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) → disrupts neuronal communication & triggers immune response      |
|    Tau Tangles      |   Hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules → forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) → disrupts intracellular transport → neuronal dysfunction & apoptosis.      |
|     Neuroinflammation     | Microglial activation fails to clear plaques → releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) →  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Chronic\|#Chronic]] inflammation causes neuronal damage        |
|    Oxidative Stress & Mitochondrial Dysfunction      | Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired mitochondrial function → reduced ATP production, energy failure, and neuronal apoptosis        |
|   Neurotransmitter Deficiency       | Loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain → decreased acetylcholine (ACh) → impaired memory and learning. Glutamate dysregulation causes excitotoxicity, further damaging neurons        |
|     Synaptic & Neuronal Loss     |Progressive synapse loss & brain atrophy (hippocampus & cortex) → cognitive decline, impaired motor function, and eventual loss of vital functions.         |


### Treatment & Management Strategies
#### Medications
##### Cholinesterase inhibitors  
![](https://i.imgur.com/99hYGII.png)
- Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that encodes and recalls memories in the hippocampus.  
- Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter.  
 - Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors combat the decreased levels of acetylcholine from [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#AD\|#AD]].  
- These medications prevent acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine

##### Memantine  
- Works by regulating the neurotransmitter glutamate
- Memantine helps improve cognitive function 
- Binds to NMDA  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]s, which are involved in glutamate signalling.  
- Blocking these  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]s, helps to reduce the overstimulation of glutamate and protect nerve cells from further damage.

##### Aducanumab and Lecanemab  
Recently approved  for early-stage [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#AD\|#AD]]monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaques in the brain to slow down cognitive declin

#### Non-pharmacological approaches  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Cognitive stimulation therapy\|#Cognitive stimulation therapy]] 
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Reminiscence therapy\|#Reminiscence therapy]]  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Behavioural therapies\|#Behavioural therapies]]  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Lifestyle modifications\|#Lifestyle modifications]]  

## Week 6  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Cardiovascular Disease\|#Cardiovascular Disease]]

### Coronary Circulation  
The heart gets blood through coronary arteries (from aorta)
If flow is reduced you get [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Angina Pectoris\|#Angina Pectoris]] and if it stops you get Myocardial Infarction
Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries reduces flow

#### 3 pathologic stages  
1. The fatty streak  
	- No  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]  
2. Plaque progression  
	- Angina  
3. Plaque disruption
	- myocardial infarction

##### The fatty streak  
- Endothelial injury – leads to its dysfunction  
- Physical stressors (E.g. high BP)  
- Chemical stressors  (E.g. smoking or high cholesterol)  
![](https://i.imgur.com/QgVIQtb.png)

##### Plaque Progression  
![](https://i.imgur.com/y4A5Wrk.png)


### Stable vs Unstable Angina
![](https://i.imgur.com/fIllMJQ.png)
Both cause [[Uni/myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]]

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]]  
#### Electrocardiogram    
ST segment depression Due to ischaemia  
His [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#ECG\|#ECG]] showed some  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Signs\|#Signs]] of [[Uni/myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]], but no permanent cardiac damage.

#### Stress testing -  exercise  
- Exercise on treadmill or cycle ergometer  
- HR, BP & [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#ECG\|#ECG]] monitored  
- Aim for 85% of max HR  
- Positive test  
	- Angina pain develops  
	- Ischaemic  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Signs\|#Signs]] on [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#ECG\|#ECG]]  
		- ‘ST depression’  
	- STOP test!
##### Pharmacological and nuclear imaging
- Inject a coronary vasodilator  
	- Ischaemic regions already  maximally vasodilated so as other regions dilate they steal blood from the diseased areas  
	- Areas that are poorly perfused do  not get as much of the radionucleotide which is injected –  look like a ‘cold spot’ on the image  
- Inject a sympathomimetic  
	- Activates adrenergic  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]s  
	- Increase force of contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy) – mimics exercise  

### Risk Factors for Developing CAD - [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Aetiology\|aetiology]]  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2Y6FVgp.png)

#### Smoking  
\>1 pack a day increases the death rate from ischaemic heart disease by 200% through
-  modification of LDL  
- Endothelial dysfunction  
- platelet adhesiveness  
- Activation of sympathetic NS  
#### Obesity  
In the UK 1 in 6 deaths due to CVD are associated with a high body-mass index
#### High blood pressure  
5 x greater risk of IHD if BP >165/95 mmHg caused by
-  wall stress – endothelial damage  
-  foam cell formation  
-  retention of LDL in vessel wall  

#### Diabetes Mellitus  
- Adults with diabetes are more 2-3 times more likely to develop  
 [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Cardiovascular Disease\|#Cardiovascular Disease]] and People with diabetes are twice as likely to die from heart disease because of
-  modification of LDL for macrophage uptake by High  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Glucose\|#Glucose]]
-  foam cell formation  
- More prone to thrombosis  
- Endothelial dysfunction from damage by high blood  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Glucose\|#Glucose]]

### Treatment of CAD  
Treatment aims to:  
- Reduce disease progression  
- Improve myocardial blood flow (oxygen supply)  
- Reduce myocardial work (oxygen demand)  
- Match supply and demand

#### Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)  
Formation of nitric oxide  
- Vascular smooth muscle relaxation  
- Causes dilation of arteries and veins  
- Reduces preload (myocardial O2 demand)  
- Dilate coronary vasculature   
- Incraese myocardial O2 supply

#### Preventative Treatment: Reduce risk factors  
- Angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors 
- Enhances vasodilation and diuresis  
- Beta adrenergic  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]s 
- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins)  
- Lower cholesterol levels  

#### Surgical intervention: Angioplasty
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
- Blockage >50%  
- No response to other  treatment  
- Several arteries affected  
##### Method  
- Use a ‘spare’ vessel (E.g. Saphenous (leg) vein)  
- Internal mammary artery  


## week 7 Mental  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]
During [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]], hormonal fluctuations occur, leading to various physical and emotional  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] such as irregular periods, hot flashes and mood swings.  

### Mental  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] Disorders  
#### Anxiety disorders:  
Patients respond to certain objects or situations or objects with fear and dread.  
Feeling of unease, worry.  
Show physical  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Signs\|#Signs]] of anxiety or panic, such as a rapid heartbeat and sweating.  
Diagnosed if the person's response is not appropriate for the situation, if the  
person cannot control the response, or if the anxiety interferes with normal  
functioning.  
Examples: generalised anxiety disorder; panic disorder; social anxiety disorder,  
and phobias.  

#### Mood disorders: 
Involve persistent feelings of sadness or fluctuations from extreme elation to  
extreme sadness. Physical  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] include sleep disturbance, fatigue.  
Examples: depression, bipolar disorder.

#### Depresssion  
Patients with a pre-existing major depressive disorder – prior to [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]], are at  
risk of relapse in the perimenopausal period and may find that anti-depressants that  
they may have been previously prescribed are perhaps no longer effective, or that a  
much higher  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Dose\|#Dose]] is required to have the same effect.  

#### Anxiety  
Anxiety  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] are often a hallmark of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] and are more likely to occur in those with a pre-existing [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] or sensitivity towards anxiety.  
Anxiety  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] are strongly linked to vasomotor  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] (hot flashes), with anxiety  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] preceding the onset of vasomotor  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]].  

### Risk factors;  
Women with a history of premenstrual  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Syndrome\|#Syndrome]] and postnatal depression are at a  
particular risk Pre-existing depression/anxiety prior to [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]];

Anxiety in Depression (in general)  
- Anxiety is common in the context of depression.  
- Anxiety  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] often appear 1 year or 2 years ahead of the onset of major depression, and with increasing age, become a more pronounced feature of major depressive episodes.  
- High levels of anxiety are associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness and greater likelihood of non-response to treatment
- Approximately 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] problem each year.  
- In England, 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] problem (such as anxiety and depression) in any given week  
- 1 in 100 women will experience depression during [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]/[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]]  
- Most women (8 out of 10) experience some  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], typically lasting about 4 years after the last period, but continuing for up to 12 years in about 10% of women.

###  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]

#### Mechanisms of disease
- Hormonal Changes: Fluctuations in Oestrogen and progesterone levels during [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] are believed to play a significant role in the development of mood disturbances. Oestrogen has known effects on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline, which are involved in mood regulation. Changes in hormone levels can disrupt the delicate balance of these neurotransmitters, contributing to  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] of depression and anxiety.  
- Neuroendocrine Dysregulation: The hormonal changes associated with [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] can also impact the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key neuroendocrine system involved in the body's stress response. Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders, including depression and anxiety.  
- Neurotransmitter Imbalance: In addition to Oestrogen, other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, may also be dysregulated during [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]], contributing to mood disturbances. Changes in the levels or activity of these neurotransmitters can affect emotional processing and mood regulation.  
- Genetic Predisposition: Genetic factors may predispose some individuals to develop depression and anxiety during [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]. Family history of mood disorders can increase the risk of experiencing similar  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] during the menopausal transition.

#### Monoamine neurotransmitters  
Serotonin helps regulate sleep, appetite, and mood and inhibits pain. It is thought to play a role in motor, cognitive, and autonomic functions. Some depressed people have reduced serotonin levels. Noradrenaline constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure. It also seems to help determine motivation and reward. It may trigger anxiety and be involved in some types of depression. Dopamine is essential to movement. It also influences motivation and plays a role in how a person perceives reality. Also plays a role in cognitive function, maternal, and reproductive behaviours.

- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]].  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] and [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]], destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]] and thought to be linked to changes in mood.  

#### Fluctuating Hormones
- Oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can be highly fluctuant and responsible for many physical and psychological  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]].  
- Oestrogen has a role in the modulation of serotonin, and serotonergic pathways are thought to be involved in the  neurobiological basis of depression.  
- When oestrogen levels fluctuate during the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] and [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]], destabilising effects on mood can therefore occur. Neurotransmitter pathways; gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), also affected by the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]] and thought to be linked to changes in mood

##### Affects of reducing levels of Oestrogen
- Hormonal fluctuations : changes in oestrogen, play a significant role in mood regulation.  
- Oestrogen, in particular, has an impact on serotonin and other neurotransmitters associated with mood.  
- Fluctuations in these hormones can disrupt the delicate balance, disruption of leading to mood disturbances.

##### Affects of reducing levels of Testosterone;  
- In addition to oestrogen, total and free testosterone levels decline with age, often beginning in the mid reproductive years.  
- There is evidence that transdermal testosterone therapy gives a meaningful improvement in psychological well-being as well as in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder.  

##### Affects of reducing levels of Progesterone;  
- Progesterone  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]s are also found within the brain, and reduced levels of progesterone, although not seen to have a consistent impact on psychological well-being, can have an impact on menopausal symptomology which would otherwise lead to an increase in psychological distress.

#### Hypothalamic–Pituitary–adrenal axis changes in depression  
- One of the most consistent biological findings in more severe depression with melancholic features, and associated with changes in the HPA axis, is the increased amount of plasma cortisol.  
- This is caused by a combination of excessive stress related cortisol release and impaired glucocorticoid  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Receptor\|#Receptor]]- mediated feedback inhibition.  
- Notably, HPA axis changes are also associated with impaired cognitive function and a failure of HPA axis  normalisation with treatment is associated with poor clinical response and high relapse.

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]
In the UK, the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] is typically based on clinical evaluation and assessment of  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], as well as consideration of a woman's age and menstrual history:  
Medical History: Require a detailed medical history, including information about menstrual patterns,  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] experienced i.e. PMS/PND, and any relevant medical conditions or medications. It's important for women to provide accurate information about their  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] and menstrual cycles, including the regularity and duration of periods.  
Physical Examination: A physical examination may be conducted to assess overall  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] and to rule out other conditions, this is not required if [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]] is suspected.  
Laboratory Tests: No specific test to definitively diagnose [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]. May need to rule out other underlying conditions.  
Symptom Assessment: Evaluate the presence and severity of  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] commonly  
associated with [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]], such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, sleep  
disturbances, and vaginal dryness. A symptom diary or questionnaire may be used to track  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] over time.

#### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] of perimenopausal depression

##### Treatment options

- Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): HRT is one of the primary treatment options for managing perimenopausal  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], including depression and anxiety. It involves the administration of oestrogen and sometimes progesterone to alleviate hormonal imbalances and associated  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]. However, it's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits of HRT with a  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]care professional, as it may not be suitable for everyone.  
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#CBT\|#CBT]] is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours associated with depression and anxiety. It has been shown to be effective in treating perimenopausal mood disorders and can be accessed through the National  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] Service (NHS) in the UK.  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Lifestyle modifications\|#Lifestyle modifications]]: Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]y diet, getting an adequate amount of sleep, and practicing stress- reduction techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises can help alleviate  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] of depression and anxiety during [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]. Additionally, support groups and counselling services can provide valuable emotional support and coping strategies.

##### NICE Guidelines  

- Fluctuating oestrogen levels have been shown to contribute to the  development of depressive  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] and low mood during the  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Perimenopause\|#Perimenopause]]. Stabilising oestrogen levels with HRT has been shown to be an effective treatment for mild to moderate depressive  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]].  
- The NICE guidelines: HRT should be considered as a treatment for low mood  that arises as a result of the [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#menopause\|#menopause]].  
- Only if the patient is experiencing severe major depressive episodes should  the use of anti-depressants be considered; selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors ([[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#SSRIs\|#SSRIs]]) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  
- HRT, preferably transdermal estradiol (gel or patch) should be offered as the  first-line treatment to women with mild perimenopausal depressive   [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]].

##### Acknowledge and Address perimenopausal  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]  
- Lifestyle measures and/or hormone replacement  therapy (HRT) alongside relevant
- Refer for [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#CBT\|#CBT]]/Mindfulness  
- Aim for a better well-being and physical and mental   [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] outcomes for patients with severe mental illness.  
- Follow up with patient – GP/Therapist
##### Psychotherapy – [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#CBT\|#CBT]]  
- Cognitive therapy is based on the concept that habitual negative thinking patterns leave patients vulnerable to depression in response to specific situations.  
- Therefore, the patient is taught to challenge the beliefs and assumptions that contribute to depression.  
- Over time, cognitive therapy has evolved to include behavioural elements; it is now known as ‘cognitive-behavioural therapy.’  
- Interventions : identify and challenge automatic thoughts, engage in  activities that provide evidence to disprove dysfunctional beliefs, modify core beliefs by reviewing evidence

##### Psychotherapy – [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#MBCT\|#MBCT]]
- ‘Mindfulness’ describes a greater awareness of what is happening in the present moment.  
- Mindfulness techniques are a way of connecting with thoughts and feelings, in order that a person can change the way they react to them.  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#MBCT\|#MBCT]] has been studied in randomised controlled trials, compared against ‘treatment as usual’, which showed that treatment with [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#MBCT\|#MBCT]] reduced the risk of depressive relapse

Antidepressants (Only in more severe cases – MDD)  
- Antidepressants are the main pharmacological agents used in the treatment of major depressive disorder.  
- Several classes of antidepressant are available; [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#SSRIs\|#SSRIs]] are  generally the most commonly prescribed.  
- A patient requiring an antidepressant for a first major  depressive episode will generally receive  monotherapy

#### selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
- The [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#SSRIs\|#SSRIs]] are thought to restore the levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft by binding at the serotonin re-uptake transporter preventing the re-uptake and subsequent  degradation of serotonin.  
- This re-uptake blockade leads to the accumulation of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and the concentration of serotonin returns to within the normal range.  
- This action of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#SSRIs\|#SSRIs]] is thought to contribute to the alleviation of the  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] of depression

## Tuberculosis
- An infectious disease that affects the lungs  
- Caused by bacteria – [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Mycobacterium tuberculosis\|#Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]  
- Can be fatal if not treated properly
### Risk Factors  
- Overcrowding  
- Migration of people  
- Diabetes  
- Weakened Immune system  
- Tobacco use  
- Malnourished  
- Alcoholism

### Mode of Transmission  
- Spreads when an infected person talks/ coughs/ sneezes/shouts etc  
- Inhalation of droplets  
- Another person breathes in the bacteria  
- Spread via airborne particles called droplet nuclei  
- Transmission occurs when droplet nuclei are inhaled and reach the alveoli of the lungs, via nasal passages, respiratory tract, and bronchi

### Pathogenesis  
- Droplet nuclei containing tubercle bacilli are inhaled, enter the lungs, and travel to the  
- alveoli. Tubercle bacilli multiply in alveoli
- A small number of tubercle bacilli enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body. The tubercle bacilli may reach any part of the body
- Immunocompetent host –Within 2 to 8 weeks, special immune cells called macrophages ingest and surround the tubercle bacilli. The cells form a barrier shell, called a granuloma, that keeps the bacilli contained and under control (LTBI).
- If the immune system cannot keep the tubercle bacilli under control, the bacilli begin to multiply rapidly ([[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]disease). This process can occur in different areas in the body
### Inside the body  
- Breathe in infected air and bacilli go to lungs through  bronchioles  
- Bacilli infect alveoli  
- Macrophages attack bacteria, but some survive  
- Infected macrophages separate and form tubercles  
- Dead cells form granulomas

### Microbiology  
#### Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
1. Aerobic  
2. Non-spore forming ,non-motile  
3. Rod 2—5 mm long  
4. Resistant to disinfectant  
5. Once stained it resists de-colorization with acid and alcohol facultative intracellular organism  
6. Human is the main reservoir of MTB

### Active Vs Latent Infection  
“Un [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]y” person  
- Bacilli overwhelm immune system  
-  Bacilli break out of tubercles in alveoli and spread through bloodstream  
- This is (active)[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]  
 [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]]y person  
- Initial infection controlled by immune system  
- Bacilli remain confined in tubercles for years  
- This is(latent)[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis  
- Primary: the lung is the First organ involved  
- Asymptomatic  
- Heals spontaneously  
- CXR normal  
- Result from  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Health\|#Health]] reactivation of latent infection  
-  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] include - Fever and night sweat - Weight loss - Cough...  
- non-productive then productive  
- HIV patients are more likely to develop active[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] because HIV destroys  
- T-cells. -In the west every HIV patient is tested for[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]

### Tuberculous lymphadenitis  
- Localized painless swelling  
- Early disease: glands are discrete  
- Late disease: glands are matted  
- Initially, lymph nodes are discrete then as disease progresses and caseation increases they will become matted.  
- The best samples of lymph nodes are excisional so choose the largest one (lymph node should be 1 cm +).  
- After Excision lymph nodes should be dipped in saline only and not formalin because formalin may kill the organisms in tissue.
### Pleural [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]  
Result from penetration by few bacilli into the pleural space  
- Pleural effusion and fever
### Spinal [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]  
- Dorsal site is most common site  
- Involve two vertebral bodies and destroy the disc in between  
- In Advanced disease Collapse fracture of the bodies
### Tuberculosis Meningitis  
- Mostly affects children and may affect some adults  
- Source: – Blood spread – Rupture of a sub-ependymal tubercle  
-  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]]: – fever – headache – neck rigidity  
- Disease typically evolves in 2 wks.  
- In children Asymptomatic state may cause miliary tuberculosis and[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] meningitis

### [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] and AIDS/HIV  
- People with active[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] are more likely to have HIV than the general population  
-[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] can appear at any stage of HIV infection  
- Early: Typical pattern of upper lobe infiltrate  
- [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Diagnosis\|diagnosis]] can be difficult

1. Medical History  
	-  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] of pulmonary[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]:  
	- Prolonged cough (3 weeks or longer)  
	-  Chest pain  
	-  Loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss  
	- Night sweats, fever  
	- Fatigue  
2. Physical Exam  
3. Test for[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]  
4. Chest Xray  
5. Microbiological testing
	- When a patient presents with respiratory  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]] first line of  diagnostics is often a chest x-ray
	- At least three consecutive sputum specimens  
	- Each collected in 8 to 24 hour intervals  
	- At least one being an early morning specimen  
	- Collection from: coughing, induced sputum, bronchoscopy, gastric aspiration  
	- Other clinical specimens: urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, pus, or biopsy specimens
Detection of acid-fast bacilli in stained and acid-washed smears examined microscopically may provide the first bacteriologic evidence of the presence of mycobacteria in a clinical specimen. Culture remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] disease, and growing bacteria are required to perform  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Drug\|#Drug]] susceptibility testing
Currently, there are two methods available for the detection of [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Mycobacterium tuberculosis\|#Mycobacterium tuberculosis]] infection:  
- Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST)  
- Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)



#### Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain  
- Mycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods such as a Gram Stain.

![](https://i.imgur.com/948oRyk.png)


#### Mantoux Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)  
- Intradermal injection of 0,1 ml of PPD  
- Volar surface of the forearm  
- Creating a discrete, pale elevation of the skin
- Read 48 to 72 hours after the injection  
- Palpating the site of injection find an area of induration  
- Record size of induration in mm
![](https://i.imgur.com/owBuCcS.png)

#### Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs):  
IGRAs detect[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] infection by measuring the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) from patient T cells after stimulation of a whole blood sample with highly specific[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] antigens

#### QuantiFERON-[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]] Gold Plus Procedure  
1. Collect whole blood in a standard blood collection tube, or specialized QFT-Plus Blood Collection Tubes.  
2. Incubate for 16 to 24 hours at 37°C.  
3. Detect released IFNγ in harvested plasma by ELISA.  
4. Analyse results using QFT-Plus Analysis Software.

### Case Study  
 A 22-year-old female patient named Sarah presented to her GP. Sarah reports a  
cough that has been present for more than three weeks, and she has noticed a  
significant weight loss of approximately 5 kg in the last month. Sarah also noted she  
experiences night sweats occasionally, disrupting her sleep. She has no significant  
medical history or previous lung-related illnesses. The following diagnostic tests were  
carried out: Chest X-ray, Sputum Culture and Smear Test and Tuberculin Skin Test  
(TST). The results show; Chest X-ray: Infiltrates and cavitations in the upper lobe of  
the right lung, consistent with [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Pulmonary Tuberculosis\|#Pulmonary Tuberculosis]]. Sputum Culture and Smear  
Test: Positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), confirming the presence of Mycobacterium  
tuberculosis. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): A 15 mm induration is observed, indicating a  
strong immune response to[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#TB\|#TB]]
Sarah is diagnosed with [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Pulmonary Tuberculosis\|#Pulmonary Tuberculosis]] , based on her clinical  
 [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], positive sputum smear for AFB, chest X-ray findings, and a positive  
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST). Treatment: Sarah will undergo a standard anti-  
[[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Tuberculosis\|#Tuberculosis]] treatment regimen, which involves a combination of antibiotics for a  
duration of six months. The initial phase may include four  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Drug\|#Drug]]s (isoniazid, rifampin,  
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for the first two months, followed by a continuation  
phase with isoniazid and rifampin for the next four months. Regular monitoring of  
 [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Symptoms\|#Symptoms]], sputum cultures, and liver function will be conducted to assess  
treatment response and prevent potential  [[Uni/1/4BM017 Biomedical Basis of Disease/Disease#Side Effect\|#Side Effect]]s. Contact tracing will also be  
initiated to identify and test individuals who may have been in close contact with  
Sarah to prevent further transmission.
