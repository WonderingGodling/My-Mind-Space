# Infectious Diseases Case Study Analysis
### Disease Biology, 
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that resides in the lungs,caused by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Barkat, 2025).
in 2022 it was reported that tuberculosis had killed 1.3 million people

It can spread whenever an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. The inhalation of which allows droplet nuclei to reach the alveoli of the lungs, leading to the propagation of TB (Heemskerk et al., 2015).

Risk Factors include: Overcrowding, Migration, Diabetes, Weak Immune systems, Tobacco use, Malnourishment, Alcoholism (Tobin and Tristram, 2024)




### Symptoms,
With no significant medical history or previous lung-related illnesses, Sarah (from the case study) noted "a cough that lasted for more than three weeks", as well as a "significant weight loss" (5 kg in a month). She also experienced "night sweats". 

### Tests And Diagnosis
Sarah went through three tests
A chest X-ray showing infiltrates and cavitations in the upper lobe of the right lung like in figure 2. 
A sputum culture and smear test that was positive for AFB (acid-fast bacilli).  
And a tuberculin skin test showing a 15 mm induration.

All of these tests provided a positive result for TB, confirming the suspicions caused by her clinical symptoms. This is why she was diagnosed with TB.

### Treatment, 
Now diagnosed, she should be put on antibiotics for six months. The most prescribed drugs are isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. After two months she would then only be on isoniazid and rifampin for four months while having her condition, symptoms and liver functions tested (Barkat, 2025). The results of the test will confirm if the treatment is working and if any side effects are being displayed. It is also common practice to test anybody she has been in contact with in recent history in order to prevent further spread of tuberculosis (Tobin and Tristram, 2024) (Barkat, 2025).

## Case Study
A 22-year-old female patient named Sarah presented to her GP. Sarah reports a cough  
that has been present for more than three weeks, and she has noticed a significant  
weight loss of approximately 5 kg in the last month. Sarah also noted she experiences  
night sweats occasionally, disrupting her sleep. She has no significant medical history  
or previous lung-related illnesses.
The following diagnostic tests were carried out:  
Chest X-ray, Sputum Culture and Smear Test and Tuberculin Skin Test (TST). The  
results show; Chest X-ray: Infiltrates and cavitations in the upper lobe of the right lung,  
consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum Culture and Smear Test: Positive for  
acid-fast bacilli (AFB), confirming the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  
Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): A 15 mm induration is observed, indicating a strong  
immune response to Tuberculosis (TB).  Sarah is diagnosed with Pulmonary TB, based on her clinical symptoms, positive sputum smear for AFB, chest X-ray findings, and a positive TST. 

Treatment: Sarah will  undergo a standard anti-TB treatment regimen, which involves a combination of  antibiotics for a duration of six months. The initial phase may include four drugs  (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for the first two months, followed  by a continuation phase with isoniazid and rifampin for the next four months. Regular  monitoring of symptoms, sputum cultures, and liver function will be conducted to  assess treatment response and prevent potential side effects. Contact tracing will also  be initiated to identify and test individuals who may have been in close contact with  Sarah to prevent further transmission.
