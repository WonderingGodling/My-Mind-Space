# <center>Week 2 Basic Plant Anatomy I & II</center>
## Basic Plant Anatomy I

### The "Typical" Plant Body
The Shoot System  
- Above ground (usually)  
- Elevates the plant above the soil  
- Includes the leaves and the reproductive organs  
- Many functions including:  
	- photosynthesis  
	- reproduction & seed dispersal  
	- food and water conduction  

The [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]System  
- Underground (usually)  
- Anchors the plant in the soil  
- Absorbs water and nutrients  
- Conducts water and nutrients  
- Food Storage

#### Meristems
A region of localized mitosis (Where Plant cell types arise )

Meristems may be at the tip of the shoot or [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]] (apical meristem) or lateral, occurring in cylinders extending nearly the length of the plant

A cambium is a lateral meristem that produces (usually) secondary growth

Secondary growth produces both wood and cork from separate (secondary) meristems

#### Tissues
Plants have three tissue types:
1. Dermal  Tissue
The Epidermis forms a continuous, 1 Cell Thick, layer  
over the surface of most primary organs
2. Ground Tissue (parenchyma)
The Endodermis is the inner layer of the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]cortex
3. Vascular Tissue (stele)
	- Discrete bundles in stems & leaves
	- Form a ring in dicotyledonous (dicot) stems
	- Are scattered in monocotyledonous(monocot) stems
	- Divides into [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] & [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]]

##### Parenchyma
generalized plant cell type
-  alive at maturity
-  bulk of ground and vascular tissues
	- function in storage, photosynthesis
	- also in the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] and [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]] of vascular bundles
	- the largest occur in the pith region
	- ray parenchyma cells occur in wood rays, which transport materials laterally within a woody stem
	- May develop into:
		- Collenchyma cells – cellulose thickening in the corners
		- Chlorenchyma cells – contain chloroplasts
		- Sclerenchyma cells – structural tissue
	- May also develop into:
		- Sieve tubes- upper & lower cell walls contain pores lined by strands of cytoplasm penetrating adjoining cells (called callose)
		- Companion cells- thin cells with a nucleus which lie next to sieve tubes
		- Dead cells- protoplasm dies – walls become lignified & become woody
		- Tracheids-single cells with mainly spiral or ringed thickening (lignin) on their walls
		- Vessels– columns of dead cells with no end walls

###### Collenchyma
- Cellulose thickening in corners
- Typically elongated cells
- Support tissue

###### Sclerenchyma
- Thick-walled elements
- Secondary wall impregnated with lignin
- Lose their living contents at maturity
- Are support cells
	- Fibres
	- Sclereids

###### Sieve tube cells
- Characteristic of [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]] tissue of angiosperms  
- Fairly small, rounded, have a thin unlignified wall  
- Difficult to distinguish from parenchyma cells in T.S. section 
- Greatly elongated in L.S. section joined end to end to form tubes
- Cross walls have perforations – sieve plates  
- Protoplasts of adjacent cells are continuous
- Transport organic compounds around the plant
- Alive at maturity

Companion cell – small, rectangular
Dense protoplasmic contents

##### Phloem
- Important part of vascular system
- Transports carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis  
- Provides structural support  
- Positioned: 
	- Outside the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] in stems & [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|roots]]
	- Below the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] in leaves
- Compact discrete mass of small, thin-walled living cells
- Consists of 4 types of cell:
	- Phloem parenchyma
	- Sieve tube elements
	- Companion cells
	- Fibres

##### Xylem 

- Dead cells  
- Empty of cytoplasm  
- Lignified secondary walls  
- 2 types in Angiosperms:  
	- Vessel elements  
	- Tracheids

##### Anatomy of dicotyledonous stems
- Contains a ring of vascular bundles 
	- Contain [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] (inside)  
	- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|Phloem]] (outside)  
	- Cambium – between X & P, 
		- one celled & undifferentiated 
- Cortex – external to bundles
	- Pericyclic fibres (sclerenchyma)   
- Pith – internal to bundles
- Epidermis – outer layer

###### Secondary thickening

- Starts to form at the end of the 1st year of growth 
- Cambium joins with newly formed interfascicular  
- cambium to form a complete ring  
	- Divides by mitosis, i.e. becomes meristematic 
	- Produces a ring of 2ndry [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] (on inside)  
	- Produces a ring of 2ndry [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]] (on outside)  
- Annual rings – distinct difference between spring [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] & autumn [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]]
- Medullary rays – strips of parenchyma running radially through the secondary [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] 
	- Transmits water & foods  
- Cork - develops from beneath the epidermis (from phellogen)  
	- Produces phelloderm on the inside (2ndry cortex) 
	- Impervious to air, but air enters via lenticels

##### Anatomy of monocotyledonous stems  
- Vascular bundles are scattered (rather than in a ring)  
- No cambium in the vascular bundles  
- Secondary thickening does not occur (only in a few spp.)

## Basic Plant Anatomy II

### The Root
- Vascular tissue – is central  
- Can become meristematic  
- Secondary thickening can form  
- Has an epidermis  
- Inner layer is the endodermis  
- Cortex – filled with parenchyma  
- No chlorophyll  
- Storage of starch could be a feature

#### Function of Roots  
- Anchorage 
- Storage of food 
- Transport of water 

### Anatomy of the leaf
- Thin upper epidermis covered with a waxy cuticle 
	- Below is the mesophyll tissue  
- Palisade [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Parenchyma\|parenchyma]]
- Spongy mesophyll  

#### Leaf structure
- Water & minerals arrive from the vascular bundles (vein – [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] & [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]], continuous with stem) 
	- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] is on the adaxial (upper) side of the leaf  
- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] & [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#Phloem\|phloem]] of leaf bundles – like that in the stem

##### Pea - leaf stomata  
- regulates exchange of water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide  
- Guard cells cover the stoma opening

# <center>week 3 Plant Diversity I & II</center>

## Plant Diversity I - Seed Plants

### Spores v. Seeds
Spore – most important reproductive & dispersal unit of Bryophyta (haploid)
Seed- a reproductive structure
Composed of a protected embryo plant
Embryo– develops from a fertilised oosphere of a gametophyte which is at all times structurally attached to, and physiologically dependent upon, a sporophyte

### 2 types of seed bearing plants


|                                      Gymnosperms                                      |                               Angiosperms                               |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                              Naked seeds (not protected)                              |                        Protected seeds in fruit                         |
|                                     Winged seeds                                      |                             Produce flowers                             |
|                                    Wind pollinated                                    |                    Colourful to attract pollinators                     |
| Conifers produce cones (Female cones are larger contain ovules; males contain pollen) |                           Broad shaped leaves                           |
|                                  Needle like leaves                                   | Deciduous – lose all leaves once per year; remain dormant in the winter |
|                      Evergreen, leaves are continually replaced                       |                                                                         |

### Progressive changes in the life cycle of land plants
- Dominant plant from gametophyte to sporophyte
- From single gametophyte plant
	- To small male gametophyte
	- Large female gametophyte
- Heterospory
	- Microspores producing male gametophyte
	- Megaspores producing female gametophyte

###### <button type="button" class="collapsible">(Unimportant, Ignore)</button>  
<div class="content"> <p>
- Development of gametophyte within the spores before dispersal
- Retention of female megaspore in the megasporangium & development of the female gametophyte
- Development of male gametophyte within female organs
	- carpel = megasporophyll
	- N.B. a carpel = ovary, style & stigma
</p> </div>

### Life Cycle of Seed Plants
- Seed plants (spermatophytes) – show the phenomenon of alternation of generations  
- BUT the sporophyte produces 2 types of spores:  
	- Microspores  
	- Megaspores

#### Sporophyte generation  
- Sporophyte produces 2 types of spores (heterosporous) 
- Megasporangium – undergoes meiosis to produce megaspores (female gametophyte) 
- Microsporangium – undergoes meiosis to produce haploid microspores, germinate to produce male gametophyte (pollen)  
- Many gymnosperms use wind for pollination and seed dispersal

### Spore types in seed plants

Microspores (pollen grains)
- Produced in the microsporangia (anthers)
- Give rise to vestigial male gametophytes & 2 male nuclei
	- 1 fertilises the female nucleus 
	- Other joins with the 2ndry nucleus to make the triploid endosperm nucleus 
	- N.B. only in angiosperms

Megaspores (ovules)
- Produced within each megasporangium (embryo sac) 
- Produces a vestigial female gametophyte & a single female sex cell

### Seed habit
Many advantages over the life cycle of lower plants
- Development of pollen grains which are transferrable by wind or animals between plants 
- Female gametophyte is retained on the sporophyte where it is protected & nourished
- After fertilisation the whole gametophyte & the surrounding integument becomes the seed  
- In Angiosperms (as distinct from Gymnosperms) the seeds are surrounded by a modified ovary wall, the carpel, which often plays an important part in the successful dispersal of the seed

### Seed plants - Gymnospermae
- Have naked seeds – no carpel is present  
- No vessels in their [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] tissue  
- Major surviving group is the Coniferae  
- Characterised by needle-like leaves & cones
- Have seeds which are enclosed in the carpel – which becomes modified to aid dispersion  
- Double fertilisation takes place & an endosperm tissue forms within the ovule  
- Vessels are present

### Seed plants - Angiospermae  
- Have seeds which are enclosed in the carpel – which becomes modified to aid dispersion  
- Double fertilisation takes place & an endosperm  tissue forms within the ovule


### <button type="button" class="collapsible">Gymnosperms (Ignorable)</button>  
<div class="content">  
  <p>

- After fertilisation - young sporophyte is liberated as the seed
- Members show a tendency to a reduction in leaf size  
- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]] is composed of tracheids  
	- (except Gnetales – vessels)  
- Microspores pass down the micropyle & come in direct contact with the nucellus during the pollination process
</p> </div>

### Cycadophytes
- Short unbranched trunk  
- Terminal crown of long, leathery fern-like pinnate leaves  
- Mostly less than 6 feet tall  
- Large conspicuously developed pith and cortical zones in the stem
-  Found across much of tropical & subtropical parts of the world
- Relatively little development of 2º [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]]  
- All dioecious (male & female strobili on separate plants)  
- Pollen sacs on scale like micosporophylls in compact cones (microsporangia) 
- Megasporophylls also in cones  
- Pollination by wind

|         Ovules have radial symmetry          |           Ovules have bilateral symmetry           |
|          Originated from seed ferns          |            Originated from Cordaitales             |
| Limited tropical & sub-tropical distribution | Still successful. More or less global distribution |

### Significance of gymnosperms

Ecological importance
- Provide food & habitat for wildlife  
- Forests prevent soil erosion  
- Reduce greenhouse effect: fix carbon dioxide  
Economic & commercial importance  
- Lumber for wood & paper  
- Resins – wood, furniture  
- Ornamental plants (trees, landscaping)  
- Food - pine nuts (pesto)

### Angiosperms
- Undergo an alternation of generations in which the diploid, or sporophyte, generation is dominant  
- The haploid, gametophyte generation is exceedingly reduced & vestigial (more so than in the gymnosperms)

#### Angiosperm reproduction
- Starts with the development of the anther & the carpel in the flower  
- Meiosis gives rise to microspores & megaspores – which germinate to produce reduced gametophyte plants  
- Give rise to gametes which fuse & the resulting zygote has divided to form the new embryo sporophyte plant
- Process is completed with the shedding & germination of the seed, which contains the new diploid sporophyte plant as the embryo
- Microsporogenesis  
	- pollen grains are the microspores  
	- Occurs within the pollen sacs of the anther & involve spore mother cells  
	- Pollen sacs are microsporangia  
	- Each spore mother cell gives rise (via the two divisions of meiosis) to a group of 4 pollen grains  
- Usually separates into four distinct grains
- Megasporogenesis  
	- Meiosis takes place within the ovule  
- Megaspore nucleus divides mitotically to give 8 nuclei  
	- Gives rise to the 8 nucleate embryo-sac

### Pollination  
- Involves the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma  
- self-pollination is not uncommon, but some floral mechanisms encourage transfer between individual plants (cross pollination)
	- Hybrid vigor

### Fertilisation  
- When in contact with the stigma the pollen grain germinates  
- Pollen tube grows from the stigma down through the style into the ovary  
- Ovule is penetrated via the micropyle, then the nucellus &  
finally the embryo sac  
- Once the pollen tube has penetrated into the embryo sac the tip breaks down & both male gametes are discharged  
- Fertilisation involves the fusion between one of the male gametes with the single female gamete of the embryo sac
- The unique feature of fertilisation in angiosperms is that a 2nd fertilisation also takes place when a 2nd male gamete fuses to form the endosperm  
- The endosperm gives rise to nutritive tissue in the seed  
	- Provides nutrition for the embryo & young plant 
	- Often filled with food materials – carbs, fats & proteins present in labile form

## Plant Diversity II - Aquatic macrophytes (Unimportant, Ignore)

### Aquatic Plant Communities
- Microphytes - consist of microscopic organisms like algae  
- Phytoplankton that drift in the water  
- Types that attach to stones & plants  
- Attached microphytes are called the periphyton  
	- often joined by bacteria and protists  
- May form large growths on the pond  
weeds

### Definition  
 - “macro” - big, “phytes” – plants, or “hydro” phytes  
- Associated with open water or wetlands  
- Tolerate, or prefer, having water around them or their parts  
- All plants which are easily seen with the naked eye  
- Mainly form communities around the fringe of the ponds and lakes,  
- Also grow in rivers  
- May extend right across the water  
- Or limited to the fringe or littoral region

### Importance of Aquatic Plants  
- Modify the habitat  
- Provide shelter and a habitat to animals  
- Source of food  
- Supply of oxygen  
- Provide shade in hot weather  
- Link between air and water  
- Plant diversity ensures animal diversity  
- Aesthetically pleasing

### Simple classification  
- Leaves & stems within, or floating, on water  
- Upper leaves, or shoots, able to grow above the water  
- Lower leaves able to grow submerged  
- Bank plants growing above normal water level  
- Photosynthetically active parts are permanently, or submerged in freshwater, or float on the water surface or emerge above it

### Features  
- Respond to changes in water quality, to water level fluctuations & other environmental factors  
- Natural component of lake ecosystems  
- Provide habitat & food for animals  
- Concentrate nutrients & release oxygen  
- With increasing nutrient status their development causes its own problems (become weeds) 
- Respond to changes in water quality, to water level fluctuations & other environmental factors

- Provide habitat & food for animals  
- Concentrate nutrients & release oxygen  
- With increasing nutrient status their development causes its own problems (become weeds)

#### 4 General Macrophyte Categories  
- Emergent plants – generally grow on submerged substrate with the majority of the plant growing in air,  
- Floating leaved – leaves floating on the surface, but attached by long stems to the substrate,  
- Submerged – plant is predominantly submerged but may have emergent reproductive structures,  
- Free floating – grow completely unattached to substrate and generally grow at or near to the surface,

#### Emergent plants  
- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]ed in muddy soil or shallow water  
- Close to the shore  
- Send up tough, rigid stalks and leaves (to 6m), e.g. Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Sparganium erectum

#### Floating-leaf plants  
- [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]ed underwater  
- Flexible, air-filled stems support broad leaves that float on the surface  
 - Limited by the length to which their stems can grow  
- Stems may be several feet long  
	- survive in deeper water than emergent plants  
- Floating unattached plants are relatively unrestricted by depth

##### Floating Leaves – Exposed to Air & Water at the  same time  
 - Ideal – strong leathery peltate leaf, circular in shape, an entire  
margin,  
- Water-repellent upper surface, and long pliable petiole  
- Few attain this mechanical ideal  
- Trend towards it in numerous species, notably the Nymphaeceae  
- Colonise only sheltered habitats with still/slow flowing water

##### Nymphaeceae -  Water lily  
- Leaf – peltate  
	- Entire margin  
	- Circular  
- Water repellent upper surface  
- Long pliable petiole

#### Submergent plants  
 - Weak stems and feathery leaves,  
	 - grow completely underwater  
 - Can grow in still deeper water  
- Are limited by penetration of light through water
- Weak stems and feathery leaves,  
	- grow completely underwater  
- Can grow in still deeper water

##### Completely submerged e.g.Elodea sp.  
- Lack stomata - gas exchange occurs though the thin, air-permeable cuticle and a thin or even absent epidermis.  
 - The leaves are very thin or thread-like which accounts for a favourable surface (high) to volume (small) ratio.  
 - The water transport system, the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#xylem\|xylem]], is strongly reduced as water shortage is virtually impossible.  
- Their buoyancy derives from large intercellular cavities that protrude into stems and [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]s and thus facilitate oxygen transport. 
- The intensity of light underwater is relatively low; a true palisade parenchyma layer is often lacking.

#### Submerged leaves  
- Thin leaves – entire, fenestrated, dissected  
- Extremely thin cuticle  
- Presence of chloroplasts in the epidermis  
- Two main growth habits  
	- a shortened axis with a rosette of radical leaves  
	- elongated flexuous stem clothed with leaves

#### Free-floating plants  
- Float on water surface  
- Not limited by depth  
- Their dangling [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]s obtain nutrients from the water  
- Multiply rapidly and form a bright green mat on the water's surface  
- Relatively unrestricted by depth

#### Morphology  
- Have adaptive features suitable for life under water  
- Good supply of aerenchyma tissue  
- Absence of cuticle from stem/leaves  
- High concentration of chloroplasts in epidermal layer  
- Resistance to wetting and tearing  
- May show heterophylly (leaves that differ in morphology depending on whether they are submerged or emergent)

#### Zonation  
Each type of plant is limited to a range of depths, thus forming zones with different species  
- Deeper water supports only free-floating plants  
- Submergent plants (floating-leaf plants) grow in shallower water  
- Emergent plants are restricted to the shallow perimeter

#### Transition to Marsh  
- Presence of a substantial amount of emergent vegetation marks the transition from pond to marsh  
- Eventually the marsh dries and is taken over by grasses  
 - Then moisture-tolerant woody species giving rise to carr woodland (willow or alder)  
 - Eventually – larger deciduous trees or Scots pine  
conifers

#### Classic hydrosere zonation  (Lentic habitat)  
- Central open water  
- Shallower water  
- Transition zone  
- Carr dominated by  
	- Willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.)

#### Succession  
- Series of replacements of one community by another  
- Occurs in a pond as organisms die and fall to the bottom  
- Pond gradually fills in & becomes more shallow, <2000 years 
	- Species previously excluded by depth are able to colonize  
- Stages of succession - reflected by pattern of zonation - from open water to dry land  
- From pond community to more advanced successional communities

#### River & stream (Lotic) habitats  
- Longitudinal distribution downstream  
- Local level zonation patterns  
- Velocity  
- Size  
- Gradient
- Moving water influences plants directly  
	- also controls the soil  
- Some spp. grow best in still water, others in swiftly flowing streams  
- If habitats are similar in other respects similar vegetation occurs in streams of similar flow types  
- Typing of rivers using macrophytes has been developed for conservation & management


#### Lotic macrophyte communities  
- Show similar traits to those of still waters  
- Typical communities associated with different river types Communities may prefer certain soil types  
- Changes respond to water substrate, channel width & slope, flow patterns, nutrients & biotic interactions  
- Dominant pattern is of longitudinal zonation from headstream to lowlands  
 - Identified at least 40 river types – Haslam (1978)

#### 3 Basic Types of Lotic Communities  
- Mountainous (resistant geology) – fast flows & spates, coarse substrate & nutrient poor. Limited diversity, few channel species and regular washing out.  
- Upland, oligo-mesotrophic rivers – not so steep & severe, few spates, sediment accumulates, trophic status rises. Often well developed species-rich fringing communities and channel species. 
- Lowland (often alluvial, eutrophic) – steady flow, rich in nutrients, shallow with stable substrate, or may have large channels with unstable substrate, may have marked zonal changes. Fringing species may line the banks.

#### Plants as Indicators  
- Plants are sensitive indicators of the conditions in which they live  
- Much can be deduced about the site from the plants  
- If the habitat is known the expected vegetation can be predicted  
- Plants can be used to monitor and assess the remaining factors, e.g.  pollution

### Week 4 Plant Development

#### Processes of plant development
Plants respond to changes in the environment. Favourable changes are exploited, unfavourable changes are countered. Responses fall into one of two types: rapid and reversible vs slow and irreversible.

For animals, most responses are reversible. Although some plant responses belong in this category, (e.g. guard cells) most involve development and are therefore irreversible

First of all, we’ll examine the basic system of development common to most higher plants, then see how responsive it is to changes in the environment. N.B. All the cells in a plant trace their origin to an APICAL MERISTEM.  

Plant embryos consist of COTYLEDONS ( the seed leaves), and a SHOOT APICAL MERISTEM (SAM) separated from a ROOT APICAL MERISTEM (RAM) by a short ‘stem’, the HYPOCOTYL. (see Figure 1) 
Cells in apical meristems divide, generating cells of two types: (1) those that continue to divide, maintaining the meristem, and (2) those that stop dividing and build the plant.

The arresting cells also fall into two types: (1) those that promptly expand and differentiate, and (2) those for which arrest is a temporary phase. These occupy fixed positions, and resume cell division again later to build additional structures: branch roots, branch shoots, and extra girth.  

All types of cells, at any stage in their development, may respond to changes in the environment, individually or collectively as a group (as in a meristem), by altering the progress or nature of development to increase the survival chances of the plant.

APICAL MERISTEMS  
Each apical meristem is a small (approx. 100-250 um) dome of dividing cells at the very tip of every shoot or root. Both root and shoot apical meristems consist of a  
central group of cells the function of which is thought to be organisational and outer layers of cells dividing rapidly to generate new tissue.  

The distinction is more marked in roots, where the central cells are called a quiescent center (q.c.). The meristematic cells form 2 bowl shaped layers: the root initials (ri) and the cap initials (ci).

In angiosperm shoots the central zone (cz) grades off less distinctly into the meristematic regions (m). The zonation is easier to see in gymnosperm shoot apical  
meristems because the ‘central mother cells’ (cmc) divide much more slowly than their angiosperm counterparts.

Isolated SAMs and RAMs can be cultured  plants & roots on nutrient media. Thereby demonstrating their independence of the rest of the plant - they are self-contained developmental units.  

Moving back from the apex, patterns of mitotic arrest emerge. Different from qc & cz = cycling slowly; further back, cells are cycling rapidly or not cycling.

- Cells which continue to divide show up because they are smaller than other cells.  
- Roots show a clear and simple sequence of overlapping zones: an apical zone of cell elongation &, in tissue more basal, a separate zone of differentiation of root hairs & casparian strip as well as xylem and phloem.   
- Up in the shoot, development is made much more complicated by : leaf morphogenesis

#### LEAF MORPHOGENESIS  
![](https://i.imgur.com/phEJ0jX.png)
- Leaf shape and size is generated by a sequence of meristems, each independently controlled.
- During morphogenesis, a not-yet-fully formed leaf is  called a primordium.  
PHASES OF LEAF MORPHOGENESIS  
Phase 1: (See Figure 4)  
- Accelerated cell division & expansion some few cell  layers under the surface of the flanks of the apical dome heaves up a bump or buttress, the position of which is  determined only by the 2 nearest primordia (inhibitory) so that the leaves arise in a constant arrangement w.r.t. older leaves, a pattern of leaf position/arrangement known as  the phyllotaxis.  
THEREFORE PHASE 1 DETERMINES LF POSITION.

Phase 2: The Apical meristem of the leaf ( See Figure 5)  
- The +/- random divisions of the first phase stop,  & growth is taken over by a cell, or small number of cells,  just under the outermost layer.  
- Proximal (back) cells stop dividing, distal (front)  cells keep dividing and the bump or buttress grows to form  a peg which will expand to become the mid-rib.  
- The cells of the apical meristem of the leaf cease  dividing & vacuolate before the leaf is 1mm long in dicots,  0.3 mm in gymnosperms and monocots.  
PHASE 2 DETERMINES LF LENGTH

Phase 3: The marginal meristem. (See Figure 6)  
- A stripe of cells down each side of the peg &  extending 4 cells into it re-commence active cell division. The accumulated cells form 2 wings laterally, with cell  division concentrated along the margin of the growing, curved plate which will later expand to become the leaf  blade or lamina.  
Phase 4: Plate enlargement.  
- The plate is enlarged by a phase of anticlinal  (adds area) divisions scattered throughout.  
- AnticlinalAnticlinal divisions add to the area.  
--PericlinalPericlinal divisions add to the thickness.  
PHASES 3 & 4 DETERMINE LF WIDTH

Phase 5: The plate meristem.  
- A sudden wave of periclinal divisions from tip  base, generate the final 7 to 10 cell thickness.  
PHASE 5 DETERMINES LF THICKNESS  
DIFFERENT LEAF SHAPES  
- Different leaf shapes are achieved by restricting the  duration and/or distribution of individual phases, e.g. conifer  needles are generated by a similar sequence except the  activity of the marginal meristem is very limited.  
- Differences between spp are genetically determined,  but phases 4 & 5 can be under environmental control  for production of specific features.

NB* Counter predation, fenestrations in leaf as in nettles.  
 DIFFERENTIATION IN LEAVES  
- The cell division phase is followed by a phase of cell  expansion & diffn in which the spongy mesophyll cells stop  expanding earlier than other cells & therefore get ripped apart  and give rise to large intercellular spaces.  
- Cell expansion stops first in the LF tip, passing as a  wave back down to the petiole, if there is one, who's entire  devlp is v. much later than the rest of the leaf.  
- The cell expansion phase of the petiole often lasts the entire life of the LF so that growth adjustments for the  direction of light can be made.

- Petioles supported by collenchyma, whose walls thicken v. early, & phloem fibres e.g. raffia palm.  
CELL EXPANSION  
1. Cell walls1. Cell walls  
- The cell walls in tissues which are still expanding  are known as primary walls. Typically, the primary walls  are thin and consist of cellulose microfibrils in a  pectin + water matrix (gel). When cell expansion is finished,  the thicker secondary wall is laid down over the inside  of the wall in certain cell types, except where there  are clusters of plasmodesmata - pit fields. These ‘windows’  in the secondary wall are called simple pits.

- Secondary walls are made mostly of cellulose  microfibrils with a much smaller proportion of matrix  polysaccharide and water and contain lignin. This type of  cell wall provides strength, but puts a stop to cell  expansion. Hence there are problems in providing  mechanical support for the growing primary tissues.  
- For the growing primary tissues this is solved in 2For the growing primary tissues this is solved in 2  very different ways.very different ways.  
(a) Fibres: These cells belong to the class of support  
tissue called sclerenchyma with massively thickened,  hard, cellulose walls often but not always lignified. The  wall is inextensible so the cell goes on extending to cope  with the expansion of the surrounding tissue by apical  intrusive growth.

- The ends of the cell are pointed, thin walled and  cytoplasmic & they carry on growing, boring intrusively between the expanding cells while the middle section  thickens up.  
- In this way, primary tissue fibre cells reach great  lengths exploited by us in the case of flax and hemp.  
(b) Collenchyma  
These cells have very thick but extendable walls. Beginning at the corners often, parenchyma cells lay down a wall of  alternating layers of pectin & cellulose which is strong  capable of supporting up to 10-12 kg/mm2 before breaking.  
Example celery petioles

- Collenchyma is distributed in stems as a  strengthening tube. The cells are very long & thin in LS by  the time stem elongation is complete.  
SIZE-DETERMINING MERISTEMS IN THE STEM  
- Stems have various subsidiary ‘meristems’ - : zones of cell division basal to the shape determining apical  meristem.  
- One of these, known in dicots as the subapical  meristem, controls internode elongation in a simple,  quantitative way. Divisions are predominantly anticlinal ie. Add to the length, but not to the thickness of the axis separating out this activity keeps the upper internodes  v. short & as a result the developing lfs protect the  apical dome and younger lfs.

- In many plants, esp’y grasses, the m’stematic activity  wh leads to internode elongation persists, becoming  confined to a region at the base of the internode with fully diff’ned tissue above as well as below.  
- This ‘intercalated’ m’ stematic tissue is called an  intercalary meristem & also occurs in the base of grasses  lf sheath ( how grass can grow again after mowing!)



#### Control of Plant Development
 
PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS
 PGRs play an important role. The idea that their  
individual roles can be defined by the nature of the response  
to each of them (auxins  cell expansion, cytokinin  cell  
division) doesn’t fit the facts and must be discarded. At different  
times they can function in either of 2 rather different types of  
interaction:  
1) PGRs may be generated by development in one part of the  
plant (xylem differentiation in lfs  auxin, senescence or  
ripening  ethylene, plastid differentiation  gibberellins,  
ripening fruit tissue  abscisic acid, cell division in root tips   
cytokinin).

 Other parts of the same plant may be programmed  
to produce an appropriate developmental response,  
WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TISSUE OF THAT  
SPECIES AT THAT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE. The constant  
feature is the link between the particular PGR and the particular  
Devt which produced it.  
Ie. The same PGR is produced in response to a certain stimulus.  
But, the plant response to the PGR is species, tissue and time  
specific!  
2) PGRs may be synthesized in response to an environmental  
signal (drought  abscisic acid, light  gibberelins, mineral  
nutrients  cytokinins, physical stress  ethylene). Other parts  
of the same plant may be programmed to produce an appropriate  
developmental response

 The response is WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE  
FOR THAT TISSUE OF THAT SPECIES AT THAT  
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE. The constant feature is the  
link between the particular PGR and the particular env’tal  
signal in response to which its synthesis was increased.  
Different responses of different species to the same PGR are  
an important component of adaptations.  
CONTROL OF PRIMARY GROWTH:  
CELL EXPANSIONCELL EXPANSION  
 The most important co-ordinating influence on primary  
vegetative growth, and differentiation, shoot branching and  
cambial activity is auxinauxin synthesized in developing leaves.

 This auxin is swept root tip wards by a process termed  
polar transport (at 1cm per hr) as the xylem differentiates  
and the contents of vessels lyse through the living parenchyma  
cells of the stele.  
 Cell expansion determining internode length is auxin-  
dependent, so the developing leaf influences the size of  
internodes below it that will support and supply it.  
 Tropic curvature enables the expanding internodes  
to respond to light and gravity, but the mechanism remains  
obscure. The environmental signals are detected by specialized  
plastids (chloroplasts, chromoplasts, amyloplasts &  
aleoplasts’).

 Statoliths are large amyloplasts which do not disappear  
when the plant is starved and, unlike other starch grains, are  
‘loose’ inside the cell, rolling down to the lowest point when the  
plant is tilted.  
 Phototropism, growth in response to the direction of  
light is mediated by a yellow flavoprotein photoreceptor  
maximally sensitive to blue light.  
 Sensitivity to phototropic stimuli in coleoptiles correlates  
with special bright yellow plastids unique to cells of the bundle-  
sheath. Leaves have statoliths in the bundle sheaths only stems  
have them in the endodermis (but in roots they are in the root  
cap).

 The most likely explanation is that the specialised  
plastids influence the transport of auxin from the polar  
transport stream in the stele to the expanding tissues of the  
cortex, blocking the radial outwards movement of auxin on the  
illuminated or upper side.  
BUT AUXIN IS NOT THE ONLY PGR INFLUENCING CELLBUT AUXIN IS NOT THE ONLY PGR INFLUENCING CELL  
EXPANSION!EXPANSION!  
 Differentiating leaves export gibberellins which promote  
cell expansion (& directly regulate the activity of the subapical  
meristem, promoting cell divisions that increase internode  
length).

 Growing root tips export cytokinins, which promote  
cell expansion in leaves, but not in stems. When more mineral  
nutrients are available in the soil, more cytokinin is exported  
from roots, and leaves are larger in response.  
 Cell expansion is also sensitive to ethylene, part of a  
response to physical stress. The production of ethylene by  
plant tissues increases when you bend, shake or stress them.  
Elevated ethylene alters the orientation of cortical utubules  
in expanding cells, which alters the orientation of cellulose  
microfibrils synthesized. (See figure 1)  
 Subsequently, so as to increase radial cell expansion  
at the expense of longitudinal expansion  STOUTER AXIS,  
able to push up paving stones!

A. VASCULAR TISSUE  
Primary xylem requires auxin from developing lvs in order to  
differentiate. Primary phloem requires cytokinin from growing  
roots. In addition, cells in the appropriate position do not  
differentiate into fibres unless supplied with both auxin and  
gibberellin. These PGRs influence the program of differentiation.  
Increased [GA]  larger fibres increased [IAA]  thicker walls.  
B. MERISTEMOIDS  
1.General  
The way plants generate the little, tiny organs which have only a  
few cells, in what appears to be a homogenous array of identical  
cells, divide assymmetrically.

 First the nucleus moves to one end of the cell, which  
may show a ‘gradient’ of organelles across it, oriented to some  
outside influence e.g. a meristem. 2 cells are formed : a small  
cell, from the dense end, wh goes on to something exciting,  
& a large cell fm the other end of the gradient wh usually does  
not. (See figures 2 & 3).  
 The small cell usually re-commences cell division &,  
acting as tiny meristem (‘meristemoid’) goes on to generate  
one of the various types of glands, hairs & other little structures  
wh are dotted throughout & especially over the surface of plants.  
 The stomata arise from meristemoids in the

  
Control  
The purpose of meristemoids seems to be to allow independent  
control of the development of these ‘tiny’ organs, e.g. the  
timing of maturation and the spacing of the guard cells is  
obviously important for the leaf.  
CONTROL OF SECONDARY GROWTH: BRANCHING  
Lateral roots arise deep inside the root. From a single layer -  
the PERICYCLE - just inside the endodermis so that the  
integrity of the stele isn’t breached. Shoot branches arise from  
similarly arrested cells, but in pockets on the outside surface of  
the axis where they monitor light. The mechanisms of control  
of shoot branching vary from plant to plant.

COLLECTIVE DEVELOPMENTAL TRANSITIONS  
 Plant organs and especially meristems, sometimes  
undergo a major shift in biochemistry and/or pattern of  
growth. Rather like differentiation for a single cell, but this time  
for a whole group of cells there is a coordinated, synchronous  
change from the expression of one set of genes to the  
expression of a new set. Such changes we refer to as  
‘transformations’. Transformations are large scale qualitative  
transitions which form the life cycle of organs and individuals.  
A. Senscence  
This is terminal transformation for any tissue/individual, involving  
the breakdown of cell structures & macromolecules - but note  
that the initiation of this phase is by gene de-repression +  
synthesis of a range of hydrolytic enzymes = energy-consuming,  
so waterlogged, dried or poisoned lvs STAY GREEN!

 The onset of tissue senescence is controlled by auxin  
levels in the tissue wh, post dffn, slowly declines until eventually  
at v. low [auxin], tissues begin to respond to the tiny amounts of  
ethylene they produce all the time by producing excess ethylene  
wh activates the senescence process.  
 The onset of tissue senescence is adaptively entrained  
to: nutrient stress via CKs, water stress via ABA, & daylength  
via GA, the effective levels of wh. increase with daylength.  
 The [ethylene] also activates abscission, the final stage of  
tissue senescence. Scattered through the plant are groups of  
cells wh. do not  cell expansion response to auxin.  
Strategically placed, e.g. in petiole bases, they respond to  
ethylene when mature by cell expansion + partial autolysis of cell  
walls: (See figure 4)

In some spp, the entire plant may be ‘switched over’  
into senescence: monocarpic species (die at end of fruiting  
season e.g. banana plant). In soybean (Glycine max)  
it is the maturing seeds wh induce the onset of whole plant  
senescence wh in spp where it occurs, usually follows flowering  
& seed formation.  
Not only annual/biennial herbs though:Tachigalia versicolor in  
Panama, a large (40m) dicot tree, produces 70,000 winged  
seeds & promptly dies. Also, bamboos & Agave - the Century tree.

B. Induction of flowering  
1. Developmental control  
For many plants the switch is part of the internal  
development of the individual (therefore we cannot  
control it). Sometimes we observe that the transition is  
related to the accumulation of a fixed number of  
leaves (8 lvs in Datura ‘thorn apple’ 30 to 40 years  
growth in beech).

2. Environmental control  
(therefore we can control it and do expts!) For plants wh grow  
in regions away frm the equator, the sh m’stems  producing  
flws is adaptively entrained to daylength to make the plant  
flower at a precise time of the year. (See Figure 5)  
PHOTOPERIODISMPHOTOPERIODISM  
For other plants, especially biennials, the entrainment is to a  
prolonged period of chilling (equiv temperate winter) :  
vernalisation.  
 For photoperiodism, the ‘detector’ system is phytochrome  
as primary light sensor, linked to the endogenous circadian  
rhythm, wh connects phytochrome  apex at a fixed time after sunset every night.

detector’ system is in the developing leaves. These dvlp  
lvs produce the bulk of the GA & auxin & as they mature  
produce the bulk of the ABA & relay all the CK, wh arrives fm  
the rt, on to the sh apical meristem.  
 The ‘detector’ system triggers an altered pattern of GR  
production/relay by the lf wh the sh’ m’stems are adapted to  
interpret by transforming into floral m’stems. Sometimes the  
connection is simple, e.g. effective [GA] rises in long days, &  
in some plants wh flower in long days exogenous GA will  
induce flowering, but mostly the interactions are:  
(a) complex & prolonged, because the transition to flowering  
is critical for survival & is therefore subject to careful, multiple  
cross-checking, &

(b) species-specific, because the transition to flowering  
forms part of the machinery for adaptation to the environment  
by individual spp in a very wide range of environments.  
C. GERMINATION  
Many seeds will germinate as soon as the chemical inhibitors  
of the fruit sap have been washed off & conditions are  
favourable: water & warmth. Other types stubbornly refuse -  
they have an innate dormancy. There are 3 basic types,  
characterised by the treatment required to break dormancy.  
1. ‘After ripening’ - no germ’n unless dry at room temp for  
several wks, e.g. grasses & cereals, clover & the evening  
primrose (Oenothera).

2. Chilling req’t. Seed needs to have imbibed before it  
responds & several wks at 0 to 5o C are required =  
stratification. Same ‘dectector’ system as vernalisation.  
1. Light req’t. Mediated by phytochrome : Pfr = primary  
sensor (Pr inhibits).  
 Chilling and light trigger increases in GA, or CK,  
or both, & these PGRs initiate the mobilisation of reserves  
in the seed, ending metabolic dormancy. The dormant  
state, then, is stable until these growth substances trigger  
the transformation to active growth.

## Week 5 Floral biology and pollination

### Floral biology and pollination (Part I)

#### Agencies of pollination  
The agencies of pollination fall into two groups:  
2) Abiotic agencies : wind, water, rain.  
3) Biotic agencies : insects, birds, monkeys, small mammals (bats, rats) and small reptiles (geckos), ants, water skaters.  
Flowers have adapted to facilitate pollination by both biotic and abiotic agencies. In the case of plants which use biotic pollinators the plants and animals have coadapted and these various adaptations are called ‘adaptive syndromes’.

Some flowers are oligophilic (very few species of visitors). This tends to be most common in flowers with relatively specialised shapes (flags, trumpets, tubes), rather than ‘unsophisticated’ flowers with cup, bell or brush shapes which often have many different pollinating species (polyphilic).  

Below is a list of the major classes of pollination syndromes (not important):  
animal pollinated - Zoophily, 
insect pollinated - entomophily,  
beetles - cantharophily, 
flies - myophily, 
bees - melittophily,  
butterflies - psycophily, 
moths - phalaenophily,  
birds - ornithophily, 
bats - chireptonophily,  
wind - anemophily, 
water - hydrophily

Whichever agency is employed in pollination the plant is usually a passive partner in the transaction. Beyond the “goods for sale” display it remains static, but as in the rest of nature there are exceptions to the rule!  

These exceptions are not entirely confined to animal-pollinated species. There are also explosive discharges of pollen into the air by the anemophilous species Ricinus communis and Parietaria diffusa.

#### ABIOTIC POLLINATION AGENCIES  
##### Anemophily (wind pollination)  
Oldest type of pollination. 
The gymnosperms, are wind-pollinated at the present day and were presumably so earlier.  
Flowers of plants which rely on the wind for pollination are generally small and inconspicuous, and possess none of the attractive attributes of entomophilous species, but are often only composed of the essential organs only.

Wind pollinated species include - grasses and sedges, conifers and many temperate broad leaf tree species such as walnuts (Juglans), oaks (Quercus) etc.  

The flowers of anemophilous species are frequentely small, drab and dull in colour (don’t need to attract animal pollinators) and arranged in “catkins” which are  
most often unisexual. 
Male catkins are often pendulous and their axes are flexible so that they can be easily shaken or swayed by the wind.
The pollen of these species is most often small and smooth-coated. Generally speaking anemophilous species produce far greater amounts of pollen than entomophilous  
species.
Produces billions of pollen grains because wind pollination is down to chance.

 Anemophilous flowers do not possess nectaries.  
There are also very few ovules in the ovary, two in Juglans and Quercus, and one in Urtica, Parietaria,  
Ulmus, Betula and Myrica and the grasses.  
 Often wind pollinated tree species in temperate climates such as hazel (Corylus avellana) produce their tiny flowers early in the year before they produce leaves,  
and as a result the wind is able to gather the pollen without hinderance and the grains don’t get trapped in the foliage so increasing the chances of successful pollination.  
Not many wind pollinated species exist in tropical rain forests because there isnt much wind

#### Hydrophily (Water pollination)  
 Angiosperms which have “ returned to the water” show differing degrees of adaptation to their environment.  
The conservation of the flower is now exhibited in an entirely different way.  
 Eelgrass is an example of an angiosperm which bears totally submerged flowers in tropical oceans, that use hydrophilous pollination. 
 Flowers of hydrophilous species have no colour nectaries or scent since these are not required.

 Their floral envelope is small, often only consisting of a single whorl of sepals, in some cases even this is missing and the flower exists as a single naked stamen or ovary as in the submerged Star Worts, the Callitriches.  
 With this simplification is also a reduction in size.  
 
 True hydrophily where the pollen is water-borne, is rare and only occurs in totally submerged aquatic species. The most studied examples are the marine perennials, the grass wracks, Zostera, Phyllospadix and Halophila.  In these species pollen itself is modified to suit the environment. Zostera marina has separate inflorescences of male and female flowers enclosed in the base of a grass-like leaf.

 The male flower is a single sessile anther. The anther wall has no endothecium as have the land plants, and when it is mature it dehisces by absorbing water which causes the innermost cells to swell and burst the sac.  
 The pollen grains are very long and thread-like in shape. They have no exine and are shed naked into the sea. They are non-motile and coil around the stigma of the female flowers if they drift against them.

##### Rain pollination  
 The significance of rain as a pollinating agency in certain angiosperms was only recognised relatively recently (1950’s). Hagerup (1950) reported that in the  
Faroe islands (Danish group of islands in North Sea) that flowers of the Creeping Buttercup (Ranunculus repens) were wide open even on rainy days.  
 In these islands the rainfall is very high, but is very gentle and frequent, and this climate is of great importance to the pollination biology of these species growing in this region.

 R. repens is common throughout the U.K. and much of  
Northern Europe and is a typical entomophilous species its flowers have bright yellow petals, are scented, bear large amounts of pollen and also some nectar.  
 Most of the petal area is glossy and water proof, but at the base of each petal there is a dull area with a nectary hidden under a small flap. If a raindrop falls on the flower  
it dislodges pollen from the anthers on the glossy part of the petal and runs down it and is then held by the matt absorbent base.  
 Each additional drop swirls the floating pollen around the corolla cup which may become filled with water to the level of the glossy parts.

 The location of the carpels is such that the water rises by capillarity between them and the pollen is deposited on the stigma. There is a leak of water through gaps between the bases of the petals so that just enough water is held in the cup as is necessary for pollination  

#### Biotic agencies of pollination  
 Other species of flowering plants adopt a different strategy. To reduce wastage of energy (oils, proteins in pollen) in production of the huge amounts of pollen  
produced by wind pollinated species, they use animal messengers to collect the pollen and deliver it directly to the stigma of other plants of the same species.

### Floral biol. and pollination II

#### TYPES OF ANIMAL POLLINATORS  
Pollination by insects (entomophily)  
There are three main classes of flower visiting insects:  
1) Hymenoptera (social/solitary bees and wasps).  
2) Diptera (flies).  
3) Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).  
 They are all structurally adapted to allow them to exploit flowers. As mentioned earlier, insect pollinated flowers display a number of features which facilitate and attract such pollinators.
 
 1) Insect pollinated species generally have large vividly coloured flowers which can be seen from afar. If the plant  has evolved small flowers, then they are usually in the form  of an inflorescence (a bunch).  Since insect vision is most efficient in the blue/UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum. So the majority of insect pollinated species have yellow, blue or white flowers.  
 2) The shape of the perianth varies according to the  species of insect that has coevolved to pollinate a  particular flower species.
 3) ) As mentioned earlier most insects have excellent vision, but are most often only sensitive to blue and UV light. So nectar flowers have evolved markings termed nectar guides which are clearly visible in UV part of the spectrum to advertise the location of the nectar. (See figure 3).  
4) Since most insects have a good sense of smell, so perfumes have evolved as attractants. These flower scents are volatile essential oils. Little is known of the ecology of scent production by flowers. Diurnal (follow 24 hour cycle) species emit scent in daytime (Roses), whereas nocturnal species produce scent at night (Durio spp). The scent of nocturnal flowers differs from day flowers: night flowers are very sweet compared to the day flowers spicy smell (bat pollinated flowers are sour/mousy in smell).  
5) Deception - this is performed in a variety of ways by both pollen flower and nectar flower species. E.g. certain pollen flowers replace fodder pollen by structures  mimicking full anthers to attract and thereby “trick” pollinators; the most bizarre deception is the sexual deception performed by certain orchid species. For example the European mirror orchid (ground dwelling plant about 1 foot high which produces few flowers on a single stem).

 The mirror orchid flowers have an oval lip that glistens with a metallic blue-violet colour, and has a yellow border fringed with long red hairs. Each flower actually looks like species of wasps and bees native to the region in which the orchids grow. The function of this mimicry is AMAZING!  The flower is actually pretending to make sexual  
advances to the male bees! It does this even more effectively than first thought; in that the orchid produces a pheromone which resembles that emitted by sexually receptive female bees.  When a bee finds such a flower it lands on the lip of the flower and tries to copulate with the flower. 

 The bee fails but in the process the flower descends a curved petal structure which contains both female and male reproductive organs and “glues” a pair of pollinia on to his head. If the next orchid he visits has already despatched its pollinia then the column will collect his pollinia and thereby the orchid is fertilised.

#### Pollination by birds (Ornithophily)  
How birds came to be pollinators  
 As flying animals with a rough outer surface, birds possess good external prerequisites to act as plant pollinators.  
Q: How and why did birds evolve to become pollinators?  
 Among the hypotheses proposed to explain this phenomenon is that bird mediated pollination is a development from the destructive eating of flowers still observed even in present day temperate bird species (e.g. sparrows destroying crocuses in Spring if they are desperate for food).

 It has also been proposed that wood-peckers may have been tempted to change their diet (fruit eating)  A third explanation proposes that birds obtained this habit from chasing insects into flowers, and just happened by chance to find the nectar or to puncture succulent tissues; or fourthly that some species may have originally drunk water collected in the blossoms to quench their thirst in tropical forests.  
 No matter whether any or all of these explanations is true or not, certain bird species did somehow co-adapt with certain tropical/sub tropical plant species, and gave rise to the marvellous symbiotic relationships we can observe today.

#### The biology of bird pollination  
 Birds differ from the insect pollinators in that they can obtain only one of their staple foodstuffs from flowers, namely nectar, a Hummingbird may eat up to half its body weight in sugar daily! These species do not usually eat pollen, except incidentally whilst drinking nectar, and in order to obtain the protein component of their diet they eat small insects.  These bird species can only exist in regions of the world that can provide an abundant and continuous supply of insects and nectar throughout the year ie. The tropics and subtropics of the world. The equatorial belt in America between 50 North and 50 South, is the main centre of the Hummingbirds (Trochilidae).

 The tropics and sub-tropics of Africa and S.E. Asia is the home of the Sunbirds (Nectrinidae); the sugarbirds (Promeropidae) are found in South Africa and the  
Honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) are found in the S.W. pacific region. These four families comprise the majority of bird species highly adapted to visiting and pollinating flowers.  
 Hummingbirds live only in the New World. Most of which are found in Central America. Ecuador contains half the known species (130 out of 319 exist in this country).  The Sunbirds are restricted to the tropical and sub -tropical regions of the ‘Old World’. They are abundant in tropical and Southern Africa with about thirty species found native to S.E. Asia.

 The tropics and sub-tropics of Africa and S.E. Asia

region. These four families comprise the majority of bird

-tropical regions of the ‘Old World’. They are abundant in  
tropical and Southern Africa with about thirty species  
found native to S.E. Asia.

 To enlist the services of these bird species, plants  
have to attract them, and the features of flowering plants  
which demonstrate the syndrome of ornithophily  
are listed below:
Bird flowers Flower-birds  
6. Diurnal anthesis. Diurnal.  
7. Vivid colours often See best in red part  
red, yellow or orange. Of em spectrum.  
8. Flower tubular and/or Too large to land on  
hanging. Flower itself.  
9. Hard flower wall, Hard bill.  
well protected nectary.

10. Absence of scent. Little or no sense  
of smell.  
11. Nectar very abundant. Large appetite!  
12. Often deep tubular Long bill and  
flowers. Tongue.  
13. Nectar guides absent. High intelligence.  

Birds Like Similar Colours To People
Birds Have Bad Smell
 Birds are relatively large animals compared  
to insects therefore bird-pollinated plants have to be  
large enough to accommodate the head of a bird as it  
drinks its nectar and collects its pollen. Furthermore,  
the petals must been strong enough to take this treatment

 So, if you are in a tropical or sub-tropical country  
and you see a flower that is large, robust, red and  
lacks scent, it is most likely that this flower is pollinated  
by birds!  
 The most highly specialised of all nectar-feeding  
bird species are the hummingbirds. They closely resemble  
Sunbirds found in S.E. Asia in size and shape. However,  
they can beat their wings so swiftly and move them so  
precisely that they can hang in the air in front of a flower.  
In response Central American plants attract these species  
with delicate flowers which face downwards so that they  
can only be entered from the air.

#### Pollination by bats (cheiropterophily)  
 One family of mammals has been of particular  
importance to species of flowering plants namely - BATS.  
 Bats are nocturnal animals, small bat species are  
essentially insect eaters it is the larger species with  
relatively good vision that serve as plant pollinators.  
 Bat species which pollinate flowers include the  
Eonyteris and Macroglossus which include some of the  
biggest bat species of S.E. Asia. These species have long  
slender noses and very long tongues. (See figure 9 )

 When drinking nectar the tongue moves very fast  
in and out of the flower. They also eat large quantities  
of pollen. These bat species are colour blind, but pale  
flowers are visible to them.  
 To attract bat pollinators the flowers must open at  
night and be pale to be easily seen in the dark. The  
perfume of these flowers is of a musty, yeasty rather  
‘yucky’ type! Durian tree species (Durio spp) produce  
flowers that possess all these qualities.  
 Some of the fruit bats have evolved characteristics  
which further aid them in collecting nectar Macroglossus  
has a tongue as long as its body!!!!!!!

 Almost all species of wild bananas found in tropical  
countries such as Malaysia (eg Musa textilis) are bat  
pollinated.  
 Cacti also, favour bats as pollinators. In arid regions  
in which cacti grow very few animals are active during the  
day time. So many species of cacti open their flowers at  
dusk and close them again at dawn

## Week 6 Plant Stress Biology

### Environmental Stress

 Since the subject of environmental stress is  
so large and time is limited, I shall limit today’s lecture  
to a brief discussion of some of the physiological  
adaptations of angiosperm species to mineral stress.  
Adaptations to excess of mineral salts  
 HALOPHYTES: A number of angiosperms grow  
where they are periodically submerged in seawater.  
In addition, to the problems of rootaeration - coastal  
mangrove swamps. They also have to adapt to the  
salt content  
There are two aspects to this problem:  
14. The osmotic problem  
15. The chemical toxicity of Na+ ions.

 Plants adapted to deal with both these problems  
are called halophytes.  
 The problem of high salt concentration in the  
environment also has to be tackled by plants in arid  
environments where intense evaporation concentrates  
ground-water salts.  
16. The osmotic problem is solved by gearing the plant  
down to a w lower than the environment. The low  
0 is achieved by taking up salts: Na+ & Cl - but also  
higher concs of K+ & organic anions than in mesophytes  
(give defn mesophytes). The NaCl all has to be kept in the  
vacuole - the cytoplasmic machinery of halophytes has  
not evolved tolerance of high [sodium] .


 Therefore, the o of the cytoplasm has to be  
lowered somehow, or it would be squeezed dry between  
the vacuole & the external salt solution. This is achieved  
by increasing the concentration in the cytoplasm of some  
‘compatible’ solute wh does not wreck the machinery.  
For many halophytes this is proline - an amino acid  
therefore water soluble even though there is no net charge  
& proline is the most soluble aa.  
 Halophytes may contain up to 10 X the ‘normal’ level  
of [proline] found in mesophytes. For example in  
Triglochin maritima, proline accumulates to 20% of sh DW.  
Similar levels are found in the sea aster Aster tripolium.


17. The Problem of Na+ toxicity is solved in 2 different ways  
by different halophyte types:  
(a) succulent types - Some spp maintain a steady rate of  
uptake of salt, which is sequestered away inside vacuoles  
to generate a low 0 . Example Mesembryanthemum  
crystallinum which grows on the shores of the Dead Sea.  
(b) salt excretors - Most plants on a salt marsh are  
succulent - those which are not are therefore quite  
conspicuous, e.g. sea lavender (Limonium) & the grass  
Spartina. When the external [salt] goes up, these species  
take in extra salt so as to keep w more negative than that  
of the external solution enabling them to keep water  
moving into the plant.


The extra salt they secrete as a v. conc’d solution from  
specialised glands up on the lf surface where it is washed  
away by rain/dried out & blown away or, as in Atriplex  
spongiosa (desert dwelling plant) it fills up specially  
adapted trichomes (bladder) with the salt which serve to  
reflect the intense desert sun keeping the leaf cool.  
(See figure 1 for structure of a salt gland).  
Salt glands:  
 Salt glands are highly variable in morphology fm  
sp to sp & most of them are a complete mystery! Best  
understood example is that of Limonium (British salt grass).

 Mesophytes wh show some tolerance of increased  
salinity adopt a difft strategy to that of the halophytes.  
Instead of filling themselves up with salt, plants of salt-  
resistant varieties of soybean have less salt in them than  
plants of non-tolerant varieties grown on the same, mildly  
saline soils I.e. they survive by totally excluding the salt.  

TOXIC EXCESSES OF MINERAL IONS  
Occurs in mesic envt’s due to the chemistry of the  
substratum & drainage patterns. The availability of difft  
mineral ions varies widely in soils & any plant not  
specifically adapted to grow on a particular combination  
of minerals & whose physiology is not plastic enough to  
adapt rapidly will suffer metabolic imbalances.

18. Calcifuge/calcicole plants:  
Plants adapted to grow on soils associated with a high  
[Ca 2+] (alkaline soil) are termed calcicoles, plants adapted  
to grow on acidic soils are called calcifuges.  
 Very few plants are completely restricted to alkaline  
or acid soils, so the number of ‘strict’ calcicoles or  
calcifuges is few.  
 The metabolic problems experienced by mesophytes  
on acid soil are caused by the solubilization to  
comparatively high levels of Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn & Borate.  
Any or all 6 may prove to be toxic. They affect processes  
wh depend on Ca 2+ like cell wall assembly, cell expansion  
& cell division & they interfere with each others uptake &  
that of Ca++ & Mg++. Which of them proves to be  
responsible for toxicity depends on :

(1) soil chemistry  
(2) extent of acidification  
(3) the particular sensitivity of the plant concerned  
e.g. rice is very susceptible to Fe 2+ toxicity.  
Aluminium toxicity is quite common & seems to be a major  
problem for plants on acid soils. Adaptations to deal with  
soil Al+++ include:  
(1) secretion of OH- by rts to raise pH  
(2) Al+++ resistant, rt surface enzymes  
(3) Al exclusion fm the rt (wheat, barley & soybean)  
(4) Excess Al in rt, but exclusion fm the shoot (rice, rye)  
(5) Al accumulates in the sh - these are the tolerant types  
of Al rich tropical soils - e.g. tea (Camelia sinensis)  
where the old lvs have 30, 000 ppm A+++.

19. Heavy metal tolerance (Ag, Ni, Pb, Cd)  
 Some spp show tolerance to normally toxic  
excesses of heavy-metal cations not found in natural  
soils except where they overlie ore deposits. They have  
become adapted to & are now perculiary associated with  
naturallyexposed ores e.g. Viola calaminaria on Zn  
(zinc violet).  
 Also there are a number of genotypically distinct  
races of spp wh are not normally resistant to metal ion  
excess e.g. Silene vulgaris & a no of grass spp. The  
resistant types occur at low freq. <2%, on normal soil  
& are strongly selected for on soils contaminated with  
toxic levels of Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd & Ag (usually by people).

 Resistance is always spf to a particular metal  
e.g. Agrostis stolenifera (creeping bent grass)  
has separate & specific races tolerant of excesses  
of Mg, Cr, Ni, Cu & Zn & its mechanism differs fm metal to  
metal.  

MINERAL ION DEFICIENCY  
1.Calcicoles  
Calcicolous plants are very efficient at absorbing Fe from  
Fe+++ deficient acidic soils.  
Two different mechanisms for Fe-efficiency exist:  
(1) (Most common response by dicots and many  
monocots) In response to Fe-deficiency there is an  
increase in the activity of Fe+++ reductase at the  
absorptive surface of the [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]s.

 Fe+++ reductase is inhibited by high pH &  
dependent on a supply of soluble Fe, and these types  
frequently also increase H+ extrusion and sometimes  
also release simple chelators into the soil. The majority of  
calcicoles use this method.  
(2) A second method is used by grasses only . Specialized  
Fe+++ - chelating cmpds : ‘phytosiderophores’ (see Figure  
20) are released into the soil in response to Fe - deficiency.  
The Fe 3+ - phytosiderophore complex is then taken up by  
specific high affinity uptake system. High soil pH has very  
little effect on this system

 Unavailability of mineral ions is not always due to  
high pH:  
(a) underlying rocks may be nutrient - poor sands, or  
(b) resistant to weathering, like granite, or  
(C) the soils may be very old so that nearly all the nutrients  
have leached out of them. This is the case for soils over  
the flat, continental rocks of much of the tropics where  
leaching is intense & the soils are 100, 000 yrs old or more!  
We owe the fertlility of N. temp’ te soils to the glaciations.  
(2) Inorganic phosphate (IP)  
V. freqy a limiting plant nutrient, & in soils where IP  
availability is low, plants infected with a mycorrhizal fungus  
are not so severely affected as unifected plants.

 The fungus is better than rts at IP uptake where  
[IP] is low & relays enough of what it takes up to the  
plant to prevent deficiency.  
22) Nitrogen  
 Not as often limiting as other minerals. Provided  
soil is reasonably aerated, the activity of nitrifying  
bacteria living in it, close to plant [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]s, can maintain  
sufficient levels for plant growth. Global estimates of  
bacterial N fixation : 100 - 800 tons y -1.  
 Symbiotic N fixation in [[Uni/4AB026 Introduction to Plant Biology/Plant Biology#The root\|root]]nodules is often  
overemphasised by people bec. of its agricultural imp.  
In fact nodules are only found in 8 families & while plants  
such as Genista, Cytisus & Ulex can grow in very nutrient  
poor soils they must be well aerated, e.g. sands.

 Waterlogging & resultant anaerobiosis, not just  
low pH cripple bacterial nitrification and peat bogs such as  
found in Ireland are notoriously N-deficient. Nearly all  
peat bog spp have low levels of nitrate reductase in the field  
& do not respond to added NO 3- by synthesising the  
enzyme.  
23. Carnivorous plants (live in boggy ground where bacteria  
can’t live so eat insects instead!)  
 Elaborate adaptations for trapping & consuming  
insects have evolved in a number of bog plants. By devious  
lures: lurid colours, smells of putrefaction & e.g. spp  
of Sarracenia and Nepenthes (See figures 3 - 8) have a line  
of glands producinga sweet trail fm the ground up to the  
slippery rim of a fluid-filled pitcher:

 insects are attracted to a variety of traps:  
sticky,  
snappy, or  
slippery with exuded platelets of soft wax to clog the  
tarsal claws, in wh the trapped insect is digested by  
hydrolytic enzymes, chiefly proteases and  
phospholipases (no chitinase)  
 The rapid, trap movements of Dionaea are  
triggered by touch (See Figures 9 & 10) - the slower  
inflection of Drosera is a response to any form of  
combined nitrogen ( See figures 11& 12)

 Secretion of hydrolases is commonly a response  
to a wide range of forms of combined nitrogen. The  
glands producing the enzymes are all rather similar in  
construction. Secretory cells are apoplastically isolated  
fm underlying tissue by a layer of cells with a casparian  
strip.  
 In butterwort (Pinguicula) (See Figure 12 ) the  
hydrolases are pre-synthesised & stored in secretory  
glands. On stimn each gland pumps fluid out onto the  
surface of the leaf  rapid response. (Leaf is trap  
sticky leaf surface covered with sticky trichomes).
