### Classification of microbes

#### Three-Domain System
Based on the phylogenetic tree using the 16S rRNA
Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya
##### Prokaryotes
###### The Bacteria (eubacteria)
- Membranes- unbranched fatty acid chains
	- Ester bonded to glycerol
- Cell walls contain Peptidoglycan

###### The Archaea (archaebacteria)
- Live in extreme harsh environments
- Membranes- ranched fatty acid chains
	- Ether bonded to glycerol

##### Eukaryotes
###### The Eukarya (eukaryotes)
- Membranes- unbranched fatty acid chains
	- Ester bonded to glycerol
- Some have cell walls
- Protists- unicellular
- Fungi- unicellular or multicellular

(Being lazy, might make my own later)

#### Classification
|                                Classical Characteristics                                 |                                                                        |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                   Morphology – cell  shape/size is genetically  stable                   |      Compare microbial  genomes to estimate  taxonomic similarity      |
| Physiology/metabolism –  directly related to nature  and activity of microbial  proteins | Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)  from small ribosomal  subunits  (18=eukaryote) |
|                          Biochemistry –  proteomics (MALDI-TOF)                          |                                                                        |
#### Colitis (Clostridium difficile)
- Gram positive
- persistent spores
- colonises the colon causing colitis/diarrhoea

#### Bubonic Plague (ersinia pestis)
- Gram negative
- Transmitted via fleas

#### Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi)
- transmitted via ticks

### PARASITES

#### Ascariasis (Ascaris lumbricoides)
- Animal
- Transmitted via eggs
- lay eggs in gut of host

#### Amoebic Dysentery (Entamoeba histolytica)
- Protist
- transmitted via drinking contaminated water
	- (Contaminated by cysts in faecal matter)

#### Cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium parvum)
- Protist
- type of Zoonosis
- transmitted via drinking contaminated water/food or direct contact with animals
	- (Contaminated by cysts in faecal matter)

### Fungi

#### Candidiasis aka Thrush (Candida albicans)
- Fungi
- Already in body, unnoticeable unless immunocompromised

#### Ringworm/ Athlete’s Foot / Onychomycosis
- Fungi
- Transmitted via infected skin, the environment, animals

### VIRUSES
- Not alive
- Exist in and out of cells
- Extracellular virus:
	- inactive – possess very few enzymes
	- Cannot reproduce
- intracellular virus:
	- Act as nucleic acids making host cells simulate viral components

#### Commonly used word(ending)s
"Virus": viridae, virinae, virus
"Single Stranded": ssDNA
"Double Stranded": dsDNA

#### PANDEMIC VIRUSES

##### COVID-19 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COronaVirus 2)
- type of Zoonosis

##### Spanish Flu (influenza A/H1N1)

### THE BACTERIAL CELL

#### Bacterial Cell Organisational Structure
- Appendages (Attachments to the cell surface)
- Cell envelope (Capsule, cell wall and plasma membrane)
- Cytoplasmic region (Nucleoid, ribosomes, inclusion bodies)

##### Common External Bacterial Structures

Another table for me to make

#### BACTERIAL CELL WALL

##### Bacterial Cell Wall Function
- surrounds plasma membrane
- Maintains cell shape
-   Protects cell from osmotis lysis and toxisity
- Makes some viruses stronger
- Mycoplasmas and Chlamydia sp. have no cell wall
- Bacterial cell wall synthesis is targeted by antibiotics
### Gram Reaction
Hans Christian Gram (Danish physician) discovered grams in bacterial walls in 1884
- **Crystal violet** stains cells purple  
- Lugol’s iodine forms a complex with Crystal violet  
- Gram-negative cells lose this complex when exposed to ethanol
- Gram-positive cells retain purple complex  

- Safranin counterstain Dyes Gram-negative cells red  
- Counter stained Gram-positive cells stay purple

#### Peptidoglycan
- Cross-linking between strands forms a giant mesh-like structure
- Peptidoglycan sacculus is rigid but elastic
- Thickness of peptidoglycan determines Gram reaction (thick=positive, thin=negative)
- Carbohydrate backbone of 2 alternating hexose sugars
	- N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
	- N-acetylmuramic acid  (NAM)
		- NAM residues are cross-linked to peptides
#### Gram-positive Cell Wall
Single layer of peptidoglycan outside plasma membrane
##### Teichoic acids
- Polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphate groups  
- Wall teichoic acids – covalently linked to NAM residues of peptidoglycan  

##### Lipoteichoic acids 
- covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane 
- Anchors cell wall to plasma membrane – maintains cell structure  
- Facilitates attachment of Gram-positive pathogens

#### Gram-negative Cell Wall
- More complex
- Two distinct layers
	- Thin peptidoglycan layer
	- thick outer membrane
- Periplasmic space contains:
	- Thin layer of peptidoglycan
	- Proteins involved in nutrient acquisition
		- (Hydrolytic enzymes)
		- (Transport proteins)
	-  Enzymes that modify toxic compounds
		- E.g Beta lactamase break down antibiotics
	- Enzymes for peptidoglycan synthesis
- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
	- contains both lipid and carbohydrate
	- Lipid A
	- Core polysaccharide
	- O side chain/antigen
- Porins
	- Span outer membrane
	- Allow passage of nutrients and hydrophilic molecules of low Molecular weight

#### Lipopolysaccharide
- Contributes to the negative charge on bacterial cell surface
- Stabilises outer membrane structure
- Permeability barrier, restricting entry of antibiotics, detergents
- Protects pathogenic bacteria from host defences
- Lipid A portion – endotoxin 

#### Plasma Membrane
- Prevents entry of hydrophilic and charged molecules
- Bacterial cells contain hopanoids
	- Similar to cholesterol
	- Regulate membrane rigidity
	- Permeability barrier
##### Fluid mosaic model
- Bilayer of amphipathic phospholipids  
- Outer surface of hydrophilic heads  
- Inner surface of hydrophobic tails

#### Cell Envelope Layers Outside Cell Wall
- Capsule  
- Well organised layer that’s not easily washed off  
- Mainly polysaccharide  
- Some are made of protein  
- Pathogens – attach to surfaces and resist phagocytosis  
- Protect against desiccation (contain lots of water)
### CYTOPLASM

#### Nucleoid
- Supercoiled into nucleoid structure with no nuclear membrane (allowing chromosomes to be longer than the cell)
- Single (haploid) circular chromosome (dsDNA)
- Encodes all the essential genes
- Plasmids (dsDNA molecule independent of chromosome)
#### Ribosomes
- site of protein synthesis
- Excluded from the nucleoid
- Composed primarily of rRNA
- Site of action of some antibiotics

#### Inclusion Bodies
- Can take form of granules, crystals or globules
- Serve as energy and nutrient reserves
	-  Abundant under favourable conditions
	- Carbon often stored as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusions
	- Phosphate stored as polyphosphate granules

#### Bacterial Endospores
- Dormant cells, formed within a mother cell
- Form in response to environmental stress
- Core surrounded by other layers
- Extremely resistant to heat, UV radiation, chemical disinfectants, desiccation
### APPENDAGES

#### Flagella
- Allow bacteria to swim  
	- Towards nutrients  
	- Away from toxic substances  
	- Molecular motor powered by ATP
- Made of 3 parts: 
	- Filament (made of flagellin protein)  
	- Hook  
	- Basal body
##### Flagella Distribution Pattern
- Monotrichous
- Lopotrichous
- Amphitrichous
- Peritrichous
#### Pili
- Pilus (Latin for hair)
	- Fine appendages thinner and shorter than flagella  
	- Grow by adding subunits of pilin protein to their base
