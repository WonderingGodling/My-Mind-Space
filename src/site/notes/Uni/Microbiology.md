#### BACTERIAL CELL WALL

##### Bacterial Cell Wall Function
- surrounds plasma membrane
- Maintains cell shape
-   Protects cell from osmotis lysis and toxisity
- Makes some viruses stronger
- Mycoplasmas and Chlamydia sp. have no cell wall
- Bacterial cell wall synthesis is targeted by antibiotics

### Gram Reaction
Hans Christian Gram (Danish physician) discovered grams in bacterial walls in 1884
- **Crystal violet** stains cells purple  
- Lugol’s iodine forms a complex with Crystal violet  
- Gram-negative cells lose this complex when exposed to ethanol
- Gram-positive cells retain purple complex  
- Safranin counterstain Dyes Gram-negative cells red  
- Counter stained Gram-positive cells stay purple

#### Peptidoglycan
- Cross-linking between strands forms a giant mesh-like structure
- Peptidoglycan sacculus is rigid but elastic
- Thickness of peptidoglycan determines Gram reaction (thick=positive, thin=negative)
- Carbohydrate backbone of 2 alternating hexose sugars
	- N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
	- N-acetylmuramic acid  (NAM)
		- NAM residues are cross-linked to peptides

#### Gram-positive Cell Wall
Single layer of peptidoglycan outside plasma membrane

##### Teichoic acids
- Polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphate groups  
- Wall teichoic acids – covalently linked to NAM residues of peptidoglycan  

##### Lipoteichoic acids 
- covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane 
- Anchors cell wall to plasma membrane – maintains cell structure  
- Facilitates attachment of Gram-positive pathogens

#### Gram-negative Cell Wall
- More complex
- Two distinct layers
	- Thin peptidoglycan layer
	- thick outer membrane
- Periplasmic space contains:
	- Thin layer of peptidoglycan
	- Proteins involved in nutrient acquisition
		- (Hydrolytic enzymes)
		- (Transport proteins)
	-  Enzymes that modify toxic compounds
		- E.g Beta lactamase break down antibiotics
	- Enzymes for peptidoglycan synthesis
- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
	- contains both lipid and carbohydrate
	- Lipid A
	- Core polysaccharide
	- O side chain/antigen
- Porins
	- Span outer membrane
	- Allow passage of nutrients and hydrophilic molecules of low Molecular weight

#### Lipopolysaccharide
- Contributes to the negative charge on bacterial cell surface
- Stabilises outer membrane structure
- Permeability barrier, restricting entry of antibiotics, detergents
- Protects pathogenic bacteria from host defences
- Lipid A portion – endotoxin 

#### Plasma Membrane
- Prevents entry of hydrophilic and charged molecules
- Bacterial cells contain hopanoids
	- Similar to cholesterol
	- Regulate membrane rigidity
	- Permeability barrier

##### Fluid mosaic model
- Bilayer of amphipathic phospholipids  
- Outer surface of hydrophilic heads  
- Inner surface of hydrophobic tails

#### Cell Envelope Layers Outside Cell Wall
- Capsule  
- Well organised layer that’s not easily washed off  
- Mainly polysaccharide  
- Some are made of protein  
- Pathogens – attach to surfaces and resist phagocytosis  
- Protect against desiccation (contain lots of water)

#### CYTOPLASM

##### Nucleoid
- Supercoiled into nucleoid structure with no nuclear membrane (allowing chromosomes to be longer than the cell)
- Single (haploid) circular chromosome (dsDNA)
- Encodes all the essential genes
- Plasmids (dsDNA molecule independent of chromosome)
- 
##### Ribosomes
- site of protein synthesis
- Excluded from the nucleoid
- Composed primarily of rRNA
- Site of action of some antibiotics

##### Inclusion Bodies
- Can take form of granules, crystals or globules
- Serve as energy and nutrient reserves
	-  Abundant under favourable conditions
	- Carbon often stored as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusions
	- Phosphate stored as polyphosphate granules

##### Bacterial Endospores
- Dormant cells, formed within a mother cell
- Form in response to environmental stress
- Core surrounded by other layers
- Extremely resistant to heat, UV radiation, chemical disinfectants, desiccation

#### APPENDAGES

##### Flagella
- Allow bacteria to swim  
	- Towards nutrients  
	- Away from toxic substances  
	- Molecular motor powered by ATP
- Made of 3 parts: 
	- Filament (made of flagellin protein)  
	- Hook  
	- Basal body

###### Flagella Distribution Pattern
- Monotrichous
- Lopotrichous
- Amphitrichous
- Peritrichous

##### Pili
- Pilus (Latin for hair)
	- Fine appendages thinner and shorter than flagella  
	- Grow by adding subunits of pilin protein to their base


## Week 3 Bacterial growth and Genetics
![](https://i.imgur.com/5IQeekL.png)

### Bacterial growth and replication
**Binary fission:**
- Process results in two identical daughter cells  
- Time to division depends on environmental factors and species  
- Responsible for characteristic arrangement of cells  
- Growth is exponential – 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,  
- Rapid growth allows rapid evolution of traits by mutation or recombination

Bacterial growth starts with chromosome replication
Septation/division follows

Lag: inactivity
stationary: equal replication and death rate

#### Measurement of bacterial growth
Can be measured directly or indirectly
Direct:
- Microscopy
- Membrane filtration (mostly for water)
- Plate counts and viable counts – aerobic or anaerobic

Indirect:
- [[Uni/Microbiology#Turbidity\|Turbidity]] using spectrophotometry
- Biomass
- Measuring cell products – C0

##### The viable count
Allows the approximate quantity of living organisms measured from a sample
Examples for Bacteria and yeasts: 
- Spread plates  
- Pour plates  
- Miles and Misera
Doesn't take into account viable but non-culturable organisms (underestimate)

##### Turbidity
Bacterial Number can be estimated using spectroscopy.  
When a growth curve is plotted using plate counts and the optical density of a sample is high (550 – 600 nm) then the bacterial number can be determined using only turbidity

##### Growth can be used to identify an organism
As bacterial cells grow they utilise nutrients/carbon sources in different ways producing enzymes, allowing a metabolic fingerprint to be obtained (specific to the organism)  

Many systems developed to exploit differences:
Manual –agar plates – biochemical tests  
Mechanised – robotic biochemical assays  

### The bacterial chromosome
- Double stranded circular DNA molecule
- Condensed into the nucleiod
- No nuclear membrane
- Chromosome is unpaired – haploid
- Encodes all the genes required for essential cell functions

#### Chromosome Replication
Must happen for cell division
- Replication is semi-conservative – each copy made contains one new (daughter) and one old strand (parent)  
- Replication starts from a specific site the Origin of Replication (ori C)  
- Bi-directional  
- Uses a large collection of enzymes - Replisome

#### Chromosome size
- Size varies significantly between species  
	- Can infect more species - larger chromosomes
- Efficient methods for genome sequencing available only from 1995  
- whole genome “shotgun” sequencing  
- Venter & Smith: 1st to sequence Haemophilus influenzae & Mycoplasma genitalium  
- Now many available - whole genomes sequenced through automated processes – important strains  

### Bacterial gene expression
![](https://i.imgur.com/brwkY85.png)

#### Operons  
- Functionally linked genes are grouped together  
- expression controlled by a single operator (called OPERONs)  
	- All the genes in an operon are transcribed onto one large messenger RNA molecule  
- ensures that all the genes required for a particular metabolic task are expressed and active at the same time

#### Control of gene expression  
Controlled by proteins which regulate the rate of gene transcription: 
- REPRESSORs (negative control - down regulate)  
- ACTIVATORs (positive control – up regulate) 
- REGULONs: a group of operons that is co-regulated – e.g. toxins 
Can be specific proteins or products such as levels of catabolites - glucose  


#### Plasmids

Extra-chromosomal material replicated independently from host chromosome and aren't essential for survival  
- Thousands of different plasmids exist  
	- 300 isolated from strains of E. coli alone  
	- Possible to make them in the lab – plasmid vectors for cloning

##### Spread naturally by CONJUGATION  
Replication is similar to chromosome replication and starts at the origin (ori V)
Between a donor cell and recipient cell - sex pilus  
Typically circular, DS and < 5% size of chromosomes - 1 to 5 x 105 bp  


##### Medical importance of plasmids
###### Antibiotic resistance  
Aka R factors were first discovered in Japan in 1959
Increase of R plasmids correlates with increasing use of antibiotics
Usually enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic:
- β- lactamases – penicillin resistance  
- Prevent uptake by modifying cell wall  


### Mutation and recombination
![](https://i.imgur.com/e02m9FR.png)

#### Mutation in bacterial genes  
An inheritable change within a nucleotide (DNA) sequence. This can be:
- spontaneous  (natural radiation, errors during DNA replication)  
- induced  (chemical mutagens)

#### Types of mutation  
- Point mutation - affects one base pair  
- Insertion or deletion of large DNA fragment  
- Inversions and duplications

#### Examples of mutations altering gene function  
- Replacement of nucleotide resulting in amino acid substitution in a protein (missense) 
- Premature termination of protein synthesis (nonsense)  
- Change in expression levels due to changed regulation  
	- deletions or insertions

#### Recombination  
- Genes in two separate bacterial cells brought together in one  
- Occurs by transfer of genetic information between bacteria (COMMON GENE POOL)  
- Swap genes through horizontal gene transfer  
- Includes genes on plasmids  
- Happens through – Transformation, Conjugation and transduction

#### Transformation  
- Uptake of pure (naked) DNA from medium surrounding cell  
- Released into medium from lysed cells  
- DNA must integrate into chromosome to transform recipient cell (Transformants)  
- Can be induced in the lab (Plasmids)

#### Transduction  
- DNA transferred cell to cell by Bacteriophages (bacterial viruses)  
- Bacteriophage picks up partially degraded bacterial DNA by mistake, making new virus (Transducing phage)  
- Not all bacteriophages can transduce and not all bacteria are transducible

#### Conjugation  
- Cell-to-cell contact allowing transfer of DNA  
- Plasmids are self-transmissible by CONJUGATION  
	- encode the sex pilus and other transfer genes (tra region) 
	-  is the major mechanism of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes on R plasmids

## Week 4 Terrestrial Microbiology Part 1

### Soil
- Complex environment  
- Variety of microhabitats  
	- Pores in soil, plant roots, air & water pockets 
- Huge diversity of microbes  
- Each climate and soil type has own microbial community

#### Microorganisms in soil
- Many microbes live in pores in soil  
- Others are associated with plants:  
	- Rhizoplane - on root surface  
	- Rhizosphere - in close vicinity to root  
	- Mycorrhizal fungi - symbiosis with plant  
	- Give N & P to plant 
	- Take organic C from plant  
- Subsurface microbiota - microbial communities deep beneath the top-soil

##### Importance of soil microorganisms
- Global geochemical cycle  
- Essential role in agriculture & maintaining environmental quality  
- Production of Soil Organic Matter

### Types of soil
Most of Earths soil is mineral soil (less than 20% carbon)
\> 20% is organic soil

Soil Organic Matter (SOM):  all living, or once-living, materials within, or added to, the soil
- Retain nutrients, maintaining soil structure, hold water for plants  
- Can be degraded by microbes

#### SOM
Large influence on biological, chemical & physical dynamics of soil  
SOM can be enhanced using fertiliser

|           Nitrogen            |            Phosphorus             |
| :---------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| Many soils Have limited N2 Content |   Excess into lakes and streams   |
| nitrates in water (Health implications)  | Excessive growth of Cyanobacteria |



#### Production of SOM
Three step process with breakdown of:  
1. Soluble carbohydrates & proteins  
2. Complex CHOs e.g. cellulose  
3. Very resistant material e.g. lignin (complex oxygen- containing organic polymer)  

Microbes involved (covered in Part 2)  
- Streptomyces 
- Pseudomonas  
- Bacillus 
- Basidiomycete fungi

#### How to study soil microorganisms

Traditionally bacterial culture (only identified ~ 1% of community)
Advances in technology allow us to sequence the DNA in environments by Focusing on small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) or total DNA sequencing (metagenomics)

## Week 4 Terrestrial Microbiology Part 1

## Week 5 Nutrition and Respiration
### random information to start
Cells are NCHOPS
Most Abuntant MAcromolecules: Proteins
Cofactors And Enzymes Manipulate Internal Reactions
        Cofactors can be classified into two types: prosthetic groups (inorganic) and coenzymes (organic)
Glycolysis is a thing
Krebs Cycle is also a thing
Anaerobic less energy
