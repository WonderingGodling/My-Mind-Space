![](https://i.imgur.com/8JdHFin.png)
Another table for me to make

#### BACTERIAL CELL WALL

##### Bacterial Cell Wall Function
- surrounds plasma membrane
- Maintains cell shape
-   Protects cell from osmotis lysis and toxisity
- Makes some viruses stronger
- Mycoplasmas and Chlamydia sp. have no cell wall
- Bacterial cell wall synthesis is targeted by antibiotics
### Gram Reaction
Hans Christian Gram (Danish physician) discovered grams in bacterial walls in 1884
- **Crystal violet** stains cells purple  
- Lugol’s iodine forms a complex with Crystal violet  
- Gram-negative cells lose this complex when exposed to ethanol
- Gram-positive cells retain purple complex  

- Safranin counterstain Dyes Gram-negative cells red  
- Counter stained Gram-positive cells stay purple

#### Peptidoglycan
- Cross-linking between strands forms a giant mesh-like structure
- Peptidoglycan sacculus is rigid but elastic
- Thickness of peptidoglycan determines Gram reaction (thick=positive, thin=negative)
- Carbohydrate backbone of 2 alternating hexose sugars
	- N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
	- N-acetylmuramic acid  (NAM)
		- NAM residues are cross-linked to peptides
#### Gram-positive Cell Wall
Single layer of peptidoglycan outside plasma membrane
##### Teichoic acids
- Polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphate groups  
- Wall teichoic acids – covalently linked to NAM residues of peptidoglycan  

##### Lipoteichoic acids 
- covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane 
- Anchors cell wall to plasma membrane – maintains cell structure  
- Facilitates attachment of Gram-positive pathogens

#### Gram-negative Cell Wall
- More complex
- Two distinct layers
	- Thin peptidoglycan layer
	- thick outer membrane
- Periplasmic space contains:
	- Thin layer of peptidoglycan
	- Proteins involved in nutrient acquisition
		- (Hydrolytic enzymes)
		- (Transport proteins)
	-  Enzymes that modify toxic compounds
		- E.g Beta lactamase break down antibiotics
	- Enzymes for peptidoglycan synthesis
- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
	- contains both lipid and carbohydrate
	- Lipid A
	- Core polysaccharide
	- O side chain/antigen
- Porins
	- Span outer membrane
	- Allow passage of nutrients and hydrophilic molecules of low Molecular weight

#### Lipopolysaccharide
- Contributes to the negative charge on bacterial cell surface
- Stabilises outer membrane structure
- Permeability barrier, restricting entry of antibiotics, detergents
- Protects pathogenic bacteria from host defences
- Lipid A portion – endotoxin 

#### Plasma Membrane
- Prevents entry of hydrophilic and charged molecules
- Bacterial cells contain hopanoids
	- Similar to cholesterol
	- Regulate membrane rigidity
	- Permeability barrier
##### Fluid mosaic model
- Bilayer of amphipathic phospholipids  
- Outer surface of hydrophilic heads  
- Inner surface of hydrophobic tails

#### Cell Envelope Layers Outside Cell Wall
- Capsule  
- Well organised layer that’s not easily washed off  
- Mainly polysaccharide  
- Some are made of protein  
- Pathogens – attach to surfaces and resist phagocytosis  
- Protect against desiccation (contain lots of water)
### CYTOPLASM

#### Nucleoid
- Supercoiled into nucleoid structure with no nuclear membrane (allowing chromosomes to be longer than the cell)
- Single (haploid) circular chromosome (dsDNA)
- Encodes all the essential genes
- Plasmids (dsDNA molecule independent of chromosome)
#### Ribosomes
- site of protein synthesis
- Excluded from the nucleoid
- Composed primarily of rRNA
- Site of action of some antibiotics

#### Inclusion Bodies
- Can take form of granules, crystals or globules
- Serve as energy and nutrient reserves
	-  Abundant under favourable conditions
	- Carbon often stored as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusions
	- Phosphate stored as polyphosphate granules

#### Bacterial Endospores
- Dormant cells, formed within a mother cell
- Form in response to environmental stress
- Core surrounded by other layers
- Extremely resistant to heat, UV radiation, chemical disinfectants, desiccation
### APPENDAGES

#### Flagella
- Allow bacteria to swim  
	- Towards nutrients  
	- Away from toxic substances  
	- Molecular motor powered by ATP
- Made of 3 parts: 
	- Filament (made of flagellin protein)  
	- Hook  
	- Basal body
##### Flagella Distribution Pattern
- Monotrichous
- Lopotrichous
- Amphitrichous
- Peritrichous
#### Pili
- Pilus (Latin for hair)
	- Fine appendages thinner and shorter than flagella  
	- Grow by adding subunits of pilin protein to their base


## Week 3 Bacterial growth and Genetics

### Bacterial growth and replication
**Binary fission:**
- Process results in two identical daughter cells  
- Time to division depends on environmental factors and species  
- Responsible for characteristic arrangement of cells  
- Growth is exponential – 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,  
- Rapid growth allows rapid evolution of traits by mutation or recombination

Bacterial growth starts with chromosome replication
Septation/division follows

*Bacterial growth rates in lab conditions*
![Pasted image 20250203142156.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250203142156.png)
Lag: inactivity
stationary: equal replication and death rate

#### Measurement of bacterial growth
Can be measured directly or indirectly
Direct:
- Microscopy
- Membrane filtration (mostly for water)
- Plate counts and viable counts – aerobic or anaerobic

Indirect:
- [[Uni/Microbiology#Turbidity\|Turbidity]] using spectrophotometry
- Biomass
- Measuring cell products – C0

"Are really showing presence or detecting organism by its growth" (????)

##### The viable count
Allows the approximate quantity of living organisms measured from a sample
Examples for Bacteria and yeasts: 
- Spread plates  
- Pour plates  
- Miles and Misera
Doesn't take into account viable but non-culturable organisms (underestimate)

##### Turbidity
Bacterial Number can be estimated using spectroscopy.  
When a growth curve is plotted using plate counts along with the optical density of a sample from a growing culture at 550 – 600 nm, bacterial number can be determined using only turbidity

##### Growth can be used to identify an organism
As bacterial cells grow they utilise nutrients or carbon sources in different ways and produce enzymes, allowing a metabolic fingerprint to be obtained (specific to the organism)  

Many systems developed to exploit differences:
Manual –agar plates – biochemical tests  
Mechanised – robotic biochemical assays  

### The bacterial chromosome
- Double stranded circular DNA molecule
- Condensed into the nucleiod
- No nuclear membrane
- Chromosome is unpaired – haploid
- Encodes all the genes required for essential cell functions

#### Chromosome Replication
Must happen for cell division
- Replication is semi-conservative – each copy made contains one new (daughter) and one old strand (parent)  
- Replication starts from a specific site the Origin of Replication (ori C)  
- Bi-directional  
- Uses a large collection of enzymes - Replisome

#### Chromosome size
- Size varies significantly between species  
	- Can infect more species - larger chromosomes
- Efficient methods for genome sequencing available only from 1995  
- whole genome “shotgun” sequencing  
- Venter & Smith: 1st to sequence Haemophilus influenzae & Mycoplasma genitalium  
- Now many available - whole genomes sequenced through automated processes – important strains  

### Bacterial gene expression
#### Operons  
- Functionally linked genes are grouped together  
- expression controlled by a single operator (called OPERONs)  
	- All the genes in an operon are transcribed onto one large messenger RNA molecule  
- ensures that all the genes required for a particular metabolic task are expressed and active at the same time

#### Control of gene expression  
Controlled by proteins which regulate the rate of gene transcription: 
- REPRESSORs (negative control - down regulate)  
- ACTIVATORs (positive control – up regulate) 
- REGULONs: a group of operons that is co-regulated – e.g. toxins 
Can be specific proteins or products such as levels of catabolites - glucose  


### Plasmids

Extra-chromosomal genetic elements that replicate independently from host chromosome and aren't essential for survival of the bacterium  
- Thousands of different plasmids exist  
	- 300 isolated from strains of E. coli alone  
	- Possible to make them in the lab – plasmid vectors for cloning

#### Spread naturally by CONJUGATION  
Replication is similar to chromosome replication and starts at origin of replication (ori V)
Between a donor cell a recipient cell - sex pilus  
Typically circular, DS and < 5% size of chromosomes - 1 to 5 x 105 bp  


#### Medical importance of plasmids
##### Antibiotic resistance  
Aka R factors were first discovered in Japan in 1959
Increase of R plasmids correlates with increasing use of antibiotics
Usually enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic:
- β- lactamases – penicillin resistance  
- Prevent uptake by modifying cell wall  


### Mutation and recombination
#### Mutation in bacterial genes  
An inheritable change within a nucleotide (DNA) sequence. A bacterial strain carrying such a change is called a mutant. this can be:
- spontaneous - natural radiation, errors during DNA replication  
- induced - chemical mutagens
#### Types of mutation  
- Point mutation - affects one base pair  
- Insertion or deletion of large DNA fragment (due to a mobile element called a transposon)
may result in loss of gene function  
- Inversions and duplications

#### Examples of mutations altering gene function  
- Replacement of nucleotide resulting in amino acid substitution in a protein (missense)  
- Premature termination of protein synthesis (nonsense)  
- Change in expression levels due changed regulation  
	- deletions or insertions

#### Recombination  
- Genes in two separate bacterial cells brought together in one  
- Occurs by transfer of genetic information between bacteria have a COMMON GENE POOL  
- Swap genes through horizontal gene transfer  
- Includes genes on plasmids  
- Happens through – Transformation, Conjugation and transduction

#### Transformation  
- Uptake of pure (naked) DNA from medium surrounding cell  
- Released into medium from lysed cells  
- DNA must integrate into chromosome to transform recipient cell = Transformants  
- Can be induced in the lab - Plasmids

#### Transduction  
- DNA transferred cell to cell by Bacteriophages (bacterial viruses)  
- Bacteriophage picks up partially degraded bacterial DNA instead of its own by mistake when making new virus – transducing phage  
- Not all bacteriophages can transduce and not all bacteria are transducible

#### Conjugation  
- Cell-to-cell contact allowing transfer of DNA  
- Plasmids are self-transmissible by CONJUGATION  
	- encode the sex pilus and other transfer genes (tra region) 
	-  is the major mechanism of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes on R plasmids
