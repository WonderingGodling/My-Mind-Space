"So Why Does My Cat Purr?"
- What triggers your cat to purr?  
- What is going on inside the cat that makes it purr?
- Did your cat learn to purr, or is it genetically “programmed” to purr? 
- Did your cat learn to purr in specific contexts, or does is it genetically programmed to purr in some contexts? 
- What exactly happened in your cat’s life that makes it purr now?
- What is the function of purring?  
- How does purring benefit your cat?  
- How did purring affect your cat’s ancestors?
- Did modern cats like yours inherit purring behaviour from some pre-house cat ancestor?
- Did purring exist in animals before the house cat evolved?
- Do any other species closely related to house cats purr?

Possible Correct Answers
- Because she is content and comfortable 
- Because she evolved from a 10.67 to 4.23 million year old ancestor that purred, and she inherited that ability from that ancestor... 
- Because purring was adaptive/beneficial to ancestral cats, who used purring to form bonds with their mothers, so this ability was passed down many generations... purring is adaptive  
- Because your cat learned to purr as she grew up, because her previous owner/caretaker gave her lots of love when she purred, so she learned to purr to get attention




## Why Do We Study Behaviour
- Humans Have Been Interested In Animal Behaviour For A Long Time
	- Likely To Eat You
	- Hunting
	- Animal Husbandry
	- Milk/Ride/Use
- Learn About Self And Behaviour
	- What Triggers Violent Behaviour
	- How Did Complex Behaviours Develop Into More Simple Behaviours
	- How Are Behaviours Learned
		- How Is Anything Learned
	- Where Does Teamwork Come From
- Conservation/Welfare
	- What Behaviour Is Indicative Of Positive Or Negative Health
	- How Do We Modify Captivity To Allow Animals To Behave More As They Would In The Wild
	- Can We Positively Influence Behavious To Increase Propagation In Endangered Species
- Nature Vs Nurture
		- E.G
			- How Does Habitat Change Diet (If At All)
			- How Does Habitat Loss Affect Need To Engage In Stressful Behaviours
			- How Do Roads Control What Animals Do
			- What Effects Do Invasive Species Have On Native Behaviours

## What Is Behaviour

### Common Methods Used To Define Behaviour
Identify and study definable, repeatable, recognizable, manageable units  
- Often times, these are sequences or combinations of  smaller “behaviours”
- Identify sequences/combinations to which you can ascribe some sort of purpose (AKA a “function” to the sequence)

How You Define Behaviour Is Based On What Youre Studying

## Developmental Vs Ontogenetic

Innate Behaviour
Developmental Is About The Factors That Lead To The Animal Being The Kind Of Animal To Do The Thing

Proximate Questions Will Be About The Individual
Ultimate Questions Will Be About The Species As A Whole

Philopatry

If It Has A Function Its Usually Ultimate

## statistics
Descriptive
Inferential

## The 6 Basic ‘steps’ of the scientific method 
Step 1: Ask a Question 
Step 2: Do some background research/preliminary observations
Step 3: Construct a Hypothesis and TESTABLE predictions
Step 4: Test Your Predictions by Doing an Experiment/Study
Step 5: Analyse your data and draw conclusions 
Step 6: Communicate Your Results

Natural/Artificial Experiment

Nominal Catagories Have No Order, Ordinal Ones Do

Central Tendancy! lets Go!
Mode. Median. Range. Quartiles Are Dead But Who Cares

## Evolutionary Basis Of Behaviour
NAtural Selection
ECological Niche, Selection Pressure

## Genetics
