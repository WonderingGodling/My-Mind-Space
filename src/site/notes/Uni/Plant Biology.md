# Week 1 Introduction to the Plant Kingdom
## Living Organisms

5 Groups:
- Monerans (bacteria)  
- Protists  
- Fungi  
- Plants  
- Animals

## The Plant Kingdom

Separated into hierarchies of lower groupings (taxa)
Division Reflects: Biological Relatedness, Shared Characteristics (Inherited From A Common Ancestor) 

Can Also Be Grouped By: 
- Physical/Abiotic Factors (Climate, Geology & Soil)
- Plant Communities/Biotic Factors (Biomes Like Tundras)
- [[Uni/Phytosociological\|Phytosociological]] ([[Uni/National Vegetation Classification\|National Vegetation Classification]])
- Horticultural communities (Habitat/botanical grouping)

### Other
- Cellulose cell walls most common
	- Also naked-celled plants 
	- and Silica cell plants

# Week 2 Basic Plant Anatomy I & II
## Basic Plant Anatomy I

### The "Typical" Plant Body
The Shoot System  
- Above ground (usually)  
- Elevates the plant above the soil  
- Includes the leaves and the reproductive organs  
- Many functions including:  
	- photosynthesis  
	- reproduction & seed dispersal  
	- food and water conduction  

The Root System  
- Underground (usually)  
- Anchors the plant in the soil  
- Absorbs water and nutrients  
- Conducts water and nutrients  
- Food Storage

#### Meristems
A region of localized mitosis (Where Plant cell types arise )

Meristems may be at the tip of the shoot or root (apical meristem) or lateral, occurring in cylinders extending nearly the length of the plant

A cambium is a lateral meristem that produces (usually) secondary growth

Secondary growth produces both wood and cork from separate (secondary) meristems

#### Tissues
Plants have three tissue types:
1. Dermal  Tissue
The Epidermis forms a continuous, 1 Cell Thick, layer  
over the surface of most primary organs
2. Ground Tissue (parenchyma)
The Endodermis is the inner layer of the root cortex
3. Vascular Tissue (stele)
	- Discrete bundles in stems & leaves
	- Form a ring in dicotyledonous (dicot) stems
	- Are scattered in monocotyledonous(monocot) stems
	- Divides into xylem & phloem

##### Parenchyma
generalized plant cell type
-  alive at maturity
-  bulk of ground and vascular tissues
	- function in storage, photosynthesis
	- also in the xylem and phloem of vascular bundles
	- the largest occur in the pith region
	- ray parenchyma cells occur in wood rays, which transport materials laterally within a woody stem
	- May develop into:
		- Collenchyma cells – cellulose thickening in the corners
		- Chlorenchyma cells – contain chloroplasts
		- Sclerenchyma cells – structural tissue
	- May also develop into:
		- Sieve tubes- upper & lower cell walls contain pores lined by strands of cytoplasm penetrating adjoining cells (called callose)
		- Companion cells- thin cells with a nucleus which lie next to sieve tubes
		- Dead cells- protoplasm dies – walls become lignified & become woody
		- Tracheids-single cells with mainly spiral or ringed thickening (lignin) on their walls
		- Vessels– columns of dead cells with no end walls

###### Collenchyma
- Cellulose thickening in corners
- Typically elongated cells
- Support tissue

###### Sclerenchyma
- Thick-walled elements
- Secondary wall impregnated with lignin
- Lose their living contents at maturity
- Are support cells
	- Fibres
	- Sclereids

###### Sieve tube cells
- Characteristic of phloem tissue of angiosperms  
- Fairly small, rounded, have a thin unlignified wall  
- Difficult to distinguish from parenchyma cells in T.S. section 
- Greatly elongated in L.S. section joined end to end to form tubes
- Cross walls have perforations – sieve plates  
- Protoplasts of adjacent cells are continuous
- Transport organic compounds around the plant
- Alive at maturity

Companion cell – small, rectangular
Dense protoplasmic contents

##### Phloem
- Important part of vascular system
- Transports carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis  
- Provides structural support  
- Positioned: 
	- Outside the xylem in stems & roots
	- Below the xylem in leaves
- Compact discrete mass of small, thin-walled living cells
- Consists of 4 types of cell:
	- Phloem parenchyma
	- Sieve tube elements
	- Companion cells
	- Fibres

##### Xylem 

- Dead cells  
- Empty of cytoplasm  
- Lignified secondary walls  
- 2 types in Angiosperms:  
	- Vessel elements  
	- Tracheids

##### Anatomy of dicotyledonous stems
- Contains a ring of vascular bundles 
	- Contain xylem (inside)  
	- Phloem (outside)  
	- Cambium – between X & P, 
		- one celled & undifferentiated 
- Cortex – external to bundles
	- Pericyclic fibres (sclerenchyma)   
- Pith – internal to bundles
- Epidermis – outer layer

###### Secondary thickening

- Starts to form at the end of the 1st year of growth 
- Cambium joins with newly formed interfascicular  
- cambium to form a complete ring  
	- Divides by mitosis, i.e. becomes meristematic 
	- Produces a ring of 2ndry xylem (on inside)  
	- Produces a ring of 2ndry phloem (on outside)  
- Annual rings – distinct difference between spring xylem & autumn xylem
- Medullary rays – strips of parenchyma running radially through the secondary xylem 
	- Transmits water & foods  
- Cork - develops from beneath the epidermis (from phellogen)  
	- Produces phelloderm on the inside (2ndry cortex) 
	- Impervious to air, but air enters via lenticels

##### Anatomy of monocotyledonous stems  
- Vascular bundles are scattered (rather than in a ring)  
- No cambium in the vascular bundles  
- Secondary thickening does not occur (only in a few spp.)

## Basic Plant Anatomy II

### The root
- Vascular tissue – is central  
- Can become meristematic  
- Secondary thickening can form  
- Has an epidermis  
- Inner layer is the endodermis  
- Cortex – filled with parenchyma  
- No chlorophyll  
- Storage of starch could be a feature

#### Function of Roots  
- Anchorage –  
- Storage of food –  
- Transport of water -

### Anatomy of the leaf
- Thin upper epidermis covered with a waxy cuticle 
	- Below is the mesophyll tissue  
- Palisade parenchyma  
- Spongy mesophyll  

#### Leaf structure
- Water & minerals arrive from the vascular bundles (vein – xylem & phloem, continuous with stem) 
	- Xylem is on the adaxial (upper) side of the leaf  
- Xylem & phloem of leaf bundles – like that in the stem

##### Pea - leaf stomata  
- regulates exchange of water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide  
- Guard cells cover the stoma opening

|            Dicot            |   Monocot   |
|:---------------------------:|:-----------:|
|        2 cotyledons         | 1 cotyledon |
|    4x or 5x Floral parts    |  3x Floral parts           |
| Net-like (reticulate) veins |     Parallel veins        |
|      3 pores in pollen      |  1 pore in pollen           |
|     Bundled vasculature     |       Dispersed vasculature      |


## week 3 Plant Diversity I & II

### Plant Diversity - Seed Plants

#### Spores v. Seeds
Spore – most important reproductive & dispersal unit of Bryophyta (haploid)
Seed- a reproductive structure
Composed of a protected embryo plant
Embryo– develops from a fertilised oosphere of a gametophyte which is at all times structurally attached to, and physiologically dependent upon, a sporophyte

#### 2 types of seed bearing plants
