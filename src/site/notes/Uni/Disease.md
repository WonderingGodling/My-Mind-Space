### Types Of Drugs
Natural, synthetic, Semi-Synthetic, BioSynthetic 

### Terminology
Therapeutic effect
Side effects
Adverse effects
Toxic effect
Contraindication
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacodynamics

### Route of Administration
Enteral (oral) administration
Parenteral administration
Other

### Absorption
Absorption â€“the process by which the drug moves into the body from an external source

#### Characteristics of a drug favoring absorption
- Low molecular size
- Nonpolar
- Lipophilic

#### Mechanisms of solute transport across membranes
- Passive diffusion  
- Facilitated diffusion  
- Active transport  
- Endocytosis

#### Factors Affecting GI Absorption
- Gastric Emptying Time  
- Intestinal Motility  
- Food  
- Formulation Factors  (First Pass Effect)

### Bioavailability
The fraction or percentage of administered drug that reaches systemic circulation, measured relative to intravenous (IV) administration.
A Critical factor in determining drug effectiveness

#### IV Administration (100% Bioavailability)
- Direct delivery into bloodstream  
- Complete drug availability  
- No absorption barriers to overcome  
- No first-pass metabolism  
- Used as reference standard

### Drug-Protein
1. Process: Drugs attach to proteins in the bloodstream  
2. Function: Proteins transport and protect drugs  
3. Release: Controlled drug distribution to target sites  

Key point: This binding determines how  
effectively drugs move through the body and  
reach their intended targets.

### Factors Affecting Drug Distribution
#### Rate
- Membrane Permeability  
- Blood Perfusion
#### extent
- Extent of plasma protein binding  
- Regional differences in pH  
- Lipid solubility  
- Available transport mechanisms  
- Intracellular Binding  
- Factors Affecting Drug Distribution

### Biotransformation
Chemical alteration of the drug in the living organism so as to eliminate it from the body.

### Pharmacodynamics
What a drug does to the body (How and Where)

#### Types of Drug Action
1. Stimulation 
2. Inhibition/Depression 
3. Replacement  
4. Irritation 
5. Cytotoxic

#### Mechanism of Action
Targets:
- Receptors  
- Ion channels  
- Enzymes  
- Carrier proteins (transporter)  
- Interact with DNA

#### Receptors
Drug + Receptor Drug receptor complex Response

**Agonist**  
Definition: A drug that binds to a receptor  and stimulates cellular activity  
Effects: Triggers the receptor's natural biological response  

**Antagonist**  
Definition: A molecule that binds to a  
receptor but blocks or inhibits its activation  
Effects: Prevents the natural biological  
response

#### Affinity, efficacy and potency
Affinity  
A measure of how well a drug binds to a receptor.  
Can be measured as the concentration of a drug that occupies 50% of receptors  
The dissociation constant KD (more dissociated = less affinity)

Efficacy  
A measure of the magnitude of the effect once the drug is bound

Potency  
A measure of the quantity of a drug needed to produce the maximal effect
