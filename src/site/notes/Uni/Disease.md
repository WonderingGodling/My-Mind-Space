### Absorption
Absorption –the process by which the drug moves into the body from an external source

#### Characteristics of a drug favoring absorption
- Low molecular size
- Nonpolar
- Lipophilic

#### Mechanisms of solute transport across membranes
- Passive diffusion  
- Facilitated diffusion  
- Active transport  
- Endocytosis

#### Factors Affecting GI Absorption
- Gastric Emptying Time  
- Intestinal Motility  
- Food  
- Formulation Factors  (First Pass Effect)

### Bioavailability
The fraction or percentage of administered drug that reaches systemic circulation, measured relative to intravenous (IV) administration.
A Critical factor in determining drug effectiveness

#### IV Administration (100% Bioavailability)
- Direct delivery into bloodstream  
- Complete drug availability  
- No absorption barriers to overcome  
- No first-pass metabolism  
- Used as reference standard

### Drug-Protein
1. Process: Drugs attach to proteins in the bloodstream  
2. Function: Proteins transport and protect drugs  
3. Release: Controlled drug distribution to target sites  

Key point: This binding determines how  
effectively drugs move through the body and  
reach their intended targets.

### Factors Affecting Drug Distribution
#### Rate
- Membrane Permeability  
- Blood Perfusion
#### extent
- Extent of plasma protein binding  
- Regional differences in pH  
- Lipid solubility  
- Available transport mechanisms  
- Intracellular Binding  
- Factors Affecting Drug Distribution

### Biotransformation
Chemical alteration of the drug in the living organism so as to eliminate it from the body.

### Pharmacodynamics
What a drug does to the body (How and Where)

#### Types of Drug Action
1. Stimulation 
2. Inhibition/Depression 
3. Replacement  
4. Irritation 
5. Cytotoxic

#### Mechanism of Action
Targets:
- Receptors  
- Ion channels  
- Enzymes  
- Carrier proteins (transporter)  
- Interact with DNA

#### Receptors
Drug + Receptor Drug receptor complex Response

**Agonist**  
Definition: A drug that binds to a receptor  and stimulates cellular activity  
Effects: Triggers the receptor's natural biological response  

**Antagonist**  
Definition: A molecule that binds to a  
receptor but blocks or inhibits its activation  
Effects: Prevents the natural biological  
response

#### Affinity, efficacy and potency
Affinity  
A measure of how well a drug binds to a receptor.  
Can be measured as the concentration of a drug that occupies 50% of receptors  
The dissociation constant KD (more dissociated = less affinity)

Efficacy  
A measure of the magnitude of the effect once the drug is bound

Potency  
A measure of the quantity of a drug needed to produce the maximal effect

## Week 3 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Case Study 1)
### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is
A complex metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia (excessive sugar in the blood).
It arises from the body's inability to use insulin properly, known as insulin resistance, combined with a relative deficiency of insulin (insulin deficiency).

### Insulin's Role & Insulin Resistance
Insulin's Role: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. It allows glucose from the bloodstream to enter cells, to be used for energy.

Insulin Resistance: In T2DM, cells don't respond properly to insulin's signal, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells.

### Glucose in the context of T2DM
Glucose is the primary source of energy for your body's cells. It comes mostly from carbohydrates.

After you eat, glucose is absorbed into your bloodstream, where it travels to your cells to provide them with energy

### Pathogenesis
#### Insulin Resistance
Reduced tissue sensitivity- Cells in muscles, fat, and liver become less responsive to insulin, the hormone that allows glucose to enter cells for energy. This leads to decreased glucose uptake and utilisation.

Increased glucose production- The liver produces more glucose, further contributing to hyperglycaemia

#### Impaired Insulin Secretion
Beta-cell dysfunction- The pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, gradually lose their ability to secrete enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance.

Progressive decline- Over time, beta-cell function deteriorates, leading to worsening hyperglycaemia

### Laboratory Features & Diagnostic Criteria
#### HbA1C Test (Glycated Haemoglobin Test)
This blood test measures average blood sugar (glucose) level over the past 2-3 months. An A1C level of 6.5% or higher (< 5.7% is normal) on two separate tests indicates diabetes. The reason HbA1c provides an average of blood glucose levels over the past 2–3 months is due to the lifespan of red blood cells which is around 120 days.

#### Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test
This test measures blood sugar (glucose) level after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours). A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.

#### Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
This test measures your blood sugar level before and 2 hours after drinking a sugary liquid. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after the drink indicates diabetes

How it works?  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Fast for at least 8 hours before the test. A fasting blood sample is taken to establish your baseline blood sugar level.  
- Drink a sugary liquid containing a specific amount of glucose (usually 75 grams).  
- Blood samples are taken after 1-2 hours after you drink the glucose solution and measure how your blood sugar levels change over time.

#### Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test
This test measures your blood sugar level at any time of day, regardless of when you last ate. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes, indicates diabetes.

### Management Strategies?

#### 3rd Line of Management - Injectable Therapy – Insulin  
▪ May be needed if oral medications are not sufficient to achieve target blood  
sugar levels.  
▪ Different types of insulin are available, including rapid-acting, short-acting,  
intermediate-acting, long-acting, and premixed insulins.  
▪ Insulin therapy may involve multiple daily injections or the use of an insulin  
pump.

##### Sites of Insulin Injection  
Abdomen: This is a preferred site due to  
consistent absorption. Avoid the area around  
the belly button and any scars.  
Thighs: Use the middle to outer part of the  
thigh.  
Upper Arms: The back of the upper arm can  
be used, but it may be difficult to reach for  
self-injection.  
Buttocks: The upper outer area of the  
buttocks is suitable

### Case Study  
Brian, a 52-year-old plasterer, presented to his general practitioner (GP) with complaints of persistent thirst  
(polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and slow-healing wounds. He reported no history of smoking and  
consumes approximately 20 units of alcohol per week.  
During the consultation, his blood pressure (BP) was recorded at 167/97 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI)  
was calculated as 34.3 kg/m². Initial blood tests revealed an elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of  
64 mmol/mol. This test was repeated to confirm the result, yielding a subsequent HbA1c of 68 mmol/mol.  
His total cholesterol measured 5.9 mmol/L, with a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol of 3.7  
mmol/L.  
Based on these clinical findings, Brian was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The GP provided  
comprehensive counselling on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, increased physical activity,  
and weight management. Pharmacological intervention was initiated with metformin. Given Brian's elevated  
cholesterol levels and the increased cardiovascular risk associated with T2DM, the initiation of statin  
therapy is under strong consideration and will be discussed further at a follow-up appointment.
