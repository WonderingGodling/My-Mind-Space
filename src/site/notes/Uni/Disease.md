#### Receptors
Drug + Receptor Drug receptor complex Response

**Agonist**  
Definition: A drug that binds to a receptor  and stimulates cellular activity  
Effects: Triggers the receptor's natural biological response  

**Antagonist**  
Definition: A molecule that binds to a  
receptor but blocks or inhibits its activation  
Effects: Prevents the natural biological  
response

#### Affinity, efficacy and potency
Affinity  
A measure of how well a drug binds to a receptor.  
Can be measured as the concentration of a drug that occupies 50% of receptors  
The dissociation constant KD (more dissociated = less affinity)

Efficacy  
A measure of the magnitude of the effect once the drug is bound

Potency  
A measure of the quantity of a drug needed to produce the maximal effect

## Week 3 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Case Study 1)
### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is
A complex metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia (excessive sugar in the blood).
It arises from the body's inability to use insulin properly, known as insulin resistance, combined with a relative deficiency of insulin (insulin deficiency).

### Insulin's Role & Insulin Resistance
Insulin's Role: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. It allows glucose from the bloodstream to enter cells, to be used for energy.

Insulin Resistance: In T2DM, cells don't respond properly to insulin's signal, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells.

### Glucose in the context of T2DM
Glucose is the primary source of energy for your body's cells. It comes mostly from carbohydrates.

After you eat, glucose is absorbed into your bloodstream, where it travels to your cells to provide them with energy

### Pathogenesis
#### Insulin Resistance
Reduced tissue sensitivity- Cells in muscles, fat, and liver become less responsive to insulin, the hormone that allows glucose to enter cells for energy. This leads to decreased glucose uptake and utilisation.

Increased glucose production- The liver produces more glucose, further contributing to hyperglycaemia

#### Impaired Insulin Secretion
Beta-cell dysfunction- The pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin, gradually lose their ability to secrete enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance.

Progressive decline- Over time, beta-cell function deteriorates, leading to worsening hyperglycaemia

### Laboratory Features & Diagnostic Criteria
#### HbA1C Test (Glycated Haemoglobin Test)
This blood test measures average blood sugar (glucose) level over the past 2-3 months. An A1C level of 6.5% or higher (< 5.7% is normal) on two separate tests indicates diabetes. The reason HbA1c provides an average of blood glucose levels over the past 2–3 months is due to the lifespan of red blood cells which is around 120 days.

#### Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test
This test measures blood sugar (glucose) level after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours). A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.

#### Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
This test measures your blood sugar level before and 2 hours after drinking a sugary liquid. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after the drink indicates diabetes

How it works?  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Fast for at least 8 hours before the test. A fasting blood sample is taken to establish your baseline blood sugar level.  
- Drink a sugary liquid containing a specific amount of glucose (usually 75 grams).  
- Blood samples are taken after 1-2 hours after you drink the glucose solution and measure how your blood sugar levels change over time.

#### Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test
This test measures your blood sugar level at any time of day, regardless of when you last ate. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes, indicates diabetes.

### Management Strategies?

#### 3rd Line of Management - Injectable Therapy – Insulin  
▪ May be needed if oral medications are not sufficient to achieve target blood  
sugar levels.  
▪ Different types of insulin are available, including rapid-acting, short-acting,  
intermediate-acting, long-acting, and premixed insulins.  
▪ Insulin therapy may involve multiple daily injections or the use of an insulin  
pump.

##### Sites of Insulin Injection  
Abdomen: This is a preferred site due to  
consistent absorption. Avoid the area around  
the belly button and any scars.  
Thighs: Use the middle to outer part of the  
thigh.  
Upper Arms: The back of the upper arm can  
be used, but it may be difficult to reach for  
self-injection.  
Buttocks: The upper outer area of the  
buttocks is suitable

### Case Study  
Brian, a 52-year-old plasterer, presented to his general practitioner (GP) with complaints of persistent thirst  
(polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and slow-healing wounds. He reported no history of smoking and  
consumes approximately 20 units of alcohol per week.  
During the consultation, his blood pressure (BP) was recorded at 167/97 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI)  
was calculated as 34.3 kg/m². Initial blood tests revealed an elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of  
64 mmol/mol. This test was repeated to confirm the result, yielding a subsequent HbA1c of 68 mmol/mol.  
His total cholesterol measured 5.9 mmol/L, with a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol of 3.7  
mmol/L.  
Based on these clinical findings, Brian was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The GP provided  
comprehensive counselling on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, increased physical activity,  
and weight management. Pharmacological intervention was initiated with metformin. Given Brian's elevated  
cholesterol levels and the increased cardiovascular risk associated with T2DM, the initiation of statin  
therapy is under strong consideration and will be discussed further at a follow-up appointment.

## Week 4 Alzheimer’s Disease (Case Study 2)

### Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Epidemiology
  
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes.  
- The prevalence of AD increases with age, affecting 1 in 14 people aged ≥65
- Women are more likely to develop AD than men (Nearly two-thirds)
- In the UK, AD is the most common cause of dementia (decline in thinking and memory), accounting for 62% of cases.  
- As of 2024, approximately 982,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, with this number projected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040.  
- In 2022, there were 74,261 deaths attributed to AD & other dementias in the UK

### Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of AD involves progressive brain cell damage caused by abnormal protein build-up.  
1. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)  
- Beta-amyloid proteins clump together outside brain cells due to abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase & gamma-secretase  
- These plaques disrupt communication between neurons and trigger inflammation.  
- Major hallmark of AD.  
- Exact cause still unknown

2. Tau Tangles (Intracellular)  
- Tau proteins, which normally stabilise brain cell structures, become abnormal.  
- They form tangles inside neurons, blocking nutrient transport and leading to cell death.

1. Neuroinflammation & Cell Death  
- The immune system reacts to plaques and tangles, causing chronic inflammation.  
- Brain cells (neurons) die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline.  
4. Brain Shrinkage (Atrophy)  
- Over time, widespread neuron loss causes the brain to shrink, especially in the hippocampus (memory centre).

### Risk Factors of Alzheimer’s Disease
1. Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease  increases significantly with age, especially after 65.  
2. Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease increases your risk of developing the disease.  
3. Genetics: Certain genetic variations, such as the APOE ε4 allele, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
4. Cardiovascular health: Conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

### Diagnosis
1. Medical History & Physical Examination 
 - Review of symptoms, family history, and lifestyle.  
 - Assessment of overall health, medications, and past illnesses.  
2. Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests  
- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) – Assesses memory, orientation, and problem- solving skills.  
- Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) – Detects mild cognitive impairment.  
- Clock Drawing Test – Evaluates visuospatial and executive function
3. Laboratory Tests  
- Genetic testing – APOE-ε4 gene testing may be done for hereditary risk.  
4. Brain Imaging  
- MRI or CT Scan – Detects brain shrinkage.  
- PET Scan – Identifies amyloid plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s.
5. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis (in some cases)  
 - Measures levels of amyloid and tau proteins linked to AD

### Treatment & Management Strategies
#### Medications
##### Cholinesterase inhibitors  
- Acetylcholine is critical for encoding new memories and recalling stored memories. It plays a key role in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus (memory centre).  
- Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter.  
 - Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed to combat the decreased levels of acetylcholine observed in AD.  
- These medications interfere with acetylcholinesterase, preventing it from breaking down acetylcholine

##### Memantine  
- This medication works by regulating glutamate, another neurotransmitter in the brain.  
- Memantine can help improve cognitive function (i.e., memory, attention, and reasoning skills)  
- It works by blocking the effects of excess glutamate (Excitation) in the brain.  
- Specifically, it binds to NMDA receptors, which are involved in glutamate signalling.  
- By blocking these receptors, memantine helps to reduce the overstimulation of  glutamate and protect nerve cells from further damage.

##### Aducanumab and Lecanemab  
- These are recently approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaques in the brain.  
- They are approved for early-stage AD and have shown some promise in slowing down cognitive decline.


#### Non-pharmacological approaches  
##### Cognitive stimulation therapy  
This involves engaging in activities that stimulate cognitive functions, such as memory, problem-solving, and language.  
##### Reminiscence therapy  
This involves discussing past experiences and memories, often using prompts like photos or music, to improve mood and well-being.  
##### Behavioural therapies  
These can help manage behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with Alzheimer's, such as agitation, anxiety, and depression.  
##### Lifestyle modifications  
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social engagement can also help support brain health and potentially slow down the progression of Alzheimer's.

### Case Study  
A 63-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of repetitiveness, memory loss, and executive function loss beginning at age 58. This progressed to include word-finding difficulties, visuospatial skill decline, and impaired instrumental activities of daily living. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14/30 at the initial visit, with poor verbal fluency, visuospatial, and executive skills. Brain MRI at age 58 showed mild generalized cortical atrophy. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) was made. Treatment included cholinesterase inhibitors, which initially improved her MMSE score to 18/30. Later, memantine was added due to further cognitive decline (MMSE=13/30). She died at age 63 of pneumonia. A post-mortem examination confirmed the EOAD diagnosis, revealing numerous plaques and tangles, congophilic amyloid  angiopathy, and Lewy Body pathology in the amygdala. Genetic testing, conducted three years before her death, identified a novel PSEN2 mutation (L221T) and an apolipoprotein E (apoE) ε3/4 genotype
