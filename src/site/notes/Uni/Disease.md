</ul>


### Drug-Protein
1. Process: Drugs attach to proteins in the bloodstream  
2. Function: Proteins transport and protect drugs  
3. Release: Controlled drug distribution to target sites  

Key point: This binding determines how effectively drugs move through the body and reach their intended targets.

### Factors Affecting Drug Distribution

- Membrane Permeability  
- Blood Perfusion
#### extent
- Extent of plasma protein binding  
- Regional differences in pH  
- Lipid solubility  
- Available transport mechanisms  
- Intracellular Binding  

### Biotransformation

2. Inhibition/Depression 
3. Replacement  
4. Irritation 
5. Cytotoxic

#### Mechanism of Action
Targets:
- Receptors  
- Ion channels  
- Enzymes  
- Carrier proteins (transporter)  
- Interact with DNA

#### Receptors
Drug receptor complex  causes a Response

**Agonist**  
Definition: A drug that binds to a receptor  and stimulates cellular activity  
Effects: Triggers the receptor's response  

**Antagonist**  
Definition: A molecule that binds to a receptor but blocks or inhibits its activation  
Effects: Prevents the response

#### Affinity, efficacy and potency
Affinity  
How well a drug binds to a receptor.  
Measured as the concentration the drug occupying 50% of receptors  
Higher affinity, lower dissociation constant (DK)

Efficacy  
The magnitude of the bound drug's effect 

Potency  
The quantity of a drug needed to produce the maximal effect

## Week 3 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Case Study 1)
### Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is
A complex metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia (excessive blood sugar).
It arises from the body's inability to use insulin properly (insulin resistance) combined with insulin deficiency.

### Insulin's Role & Insulin Resistance
Insulin's Role: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. It allows glucose to enter cells (through blood), for energy.

Insulin Resistance: In T2DM, cells don't respond to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter cells.

### Glucose in the context of T2DM
Glucose (from carbohydrates) is a cells primary energy source.

### Pathogenesis
#### Insulin Resistance
Reduced tissue sensitivity- Cells in muscles, fat, and liver become less responsive to insulin decreasing glucose uptake and utilisation.

Increased glucose production- The liver produces more glucose, contributing to hyperglycaemia

#### Impaired Insulin Secretion
Beta-cell dysfunction- The pancreatic beta cells gradually lose their ability to secrete enough insulin to overcome resistance.

Progressive decline- Cell function deteriorates worsening hyperglycaemia

### Laboratory Features & Diagnostic Criteria
#### HbA1C Test (Glycated Haemoglobin Test)
Measures average blood glucose over 3 months. 
6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. 
HbA1c provides an average of blood glucose over 2–3 months due to the lifespan of red blood cells being 120 days.

#### Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test
Measures blood glucose after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours) to establish a baseline. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes.

#### Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
Measures blood sugar level before and 2 hours after drinking a sugary liquid (75g). A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher indicates diabetes

#### Random Plasma Glucose (RPG) Test
Measures blood sugar level at any time of day. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes, indicates diabetes.

### Management Strategies?
#### 1st Line of Management: Life-style modifications
- Dietary Modifications
- Weight Management
- Regular Physical Activity
- Smoking Cessation

#### 2nd Line of Management: Medications
- Metformin- Increase insulin sensitivity & decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis
- Gliclazide- Stimulate the beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin
- Sitagliptin- Enhance insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion
- Linagliptin- Increase incretin hormone levels, which enhance insulin release and  decrease glucagon secretion

#### 3rd Line of Management - Injectable Therapy – Insulin  
- If oral medications aren't sufficient to achieve target blood sugar levels.  
- There are rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, and premixed insulins.  
- Insulin therapy may involve multiple daily injections or the use of an insulin pump.

##### Sites of Insulin Injection  
Abdomen: preferred site due to consistent absorption. Avoid the area around the belly button and any scars.  
Thighs: middle/outer part of thigh.  
Upper Arms: The back of the upper arm can be used, but it may be difficult to reach.  
Buttocks: The upper outer area of the buttocks

### Case Study  
Brian, a 52-year-old plasterer, presented to his general practitioner (GP) with complaints of persistent thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and slow-healing wounds. He reported no history of smoking and consumes approximately 20 units of alcohol per week. During the consultation, his blood pressure (BP) was recorded at 167/97 mmHg. His body mass index (BMI) was calculated as 34.3 kg/m². Initial blood tests revealed an elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 64 mmol/mol. This test was repeated to confirm the result, yielding a subsequent HbA1c of 68 mmol/mol.  
His total cholesterol measured 5.9 mmol/L, with a non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol of 3.7 mmol/L. Based on these clinical findings, Brian was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The GP provided comprehensive counselling on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, increased physical activity, and weight management. Pharmacological intervention was initiated with metformin. Given Brian's elevated cholesterol levels and the increased cardiovascular risk associated with T2DM, the initiation of statin therapy is under strong consideration and will be discussed further at a follow-up appointment.

## Week 4 Alzheimer’s Disease (Case Study 2)

### Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Epidemiology
  
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that causes memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioural changes.  
- The prevalence of AD increases with age, affecting 1 in 14 people aged ≥65
- Women are more likely to develop AD than men (Nearly two-thirds)
- In the UK, AD is the most common cause of dementia (decline in thinking and memory), accounting for 62% of cases.  
- As of 2024, approximately 982,000 people are living with dementia in the UK, with this number projected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040.  
- In 2022, there were 74,261 deaths attributed to AD & other dementias in the UK

### Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of AD involves progressive brain cell damage caused by abnormal protein build-up.  
1. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular)  
- Beta-amyloid proteins clump together outside brain cells due to abnormal cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase & gamma-secretase  
- These plaques disrupt communication between neurons and trigger inflammation.  
- Major hallmark of AD.  
- Exact cause still unknown

2. Tau Tangles (Intracellular)  
- Tau proteins, which normally stabilise brain cell structures, become abnormal.  
- They form tangles inside neurons, blocking nutrient transport and leading to cell death.

3. Neuroinflammation & Cell Death  
- The immune system reacts to plaques and tangles, causing chronic inflammation.  
- Brain cells (neurons) die, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline.  
4. Brain Shrinkage (Atrophy)  
- Over time, widespread neuron loss causes the brain to shrink, especially in the hippocampus (memory centre).

### Symptoms
- Memory loss
- Difficulty finding words and speaking
- Confusion about time, place, and people
- misplacing items
- inability to find steps
- poor judgment/decision-making
- personality/behaviour changes
- difficulty completing familiar tasks
- loss of ability to recognise loved ones

### Risk Factors of Alzheimer’s Disease
1. Age: The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease  increases significantly with age, especially after 65.  
2. Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer's disease increases your risk of developing the disease.  
3. Genetics: Certain genetic variations, such as the APOE ε4 allele, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
4. Cardiovascular health: Conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  
5. Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease

### Diagnosis
1. Medical History & Physical Examination 
 - Review of symptoms, family history, and lifestyle.  
 - Assessment of overall health, medications, and past illnesses.  
2. Cognitive and Neuropsychological Tests  
- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) – Assesses memory, orientation, and problem- solving skills.  
- Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) – Detects mild cognitive impairment.  
- Clock Drawing Test – Evaluates visuospatial and executive function
3. Laboratory Tests  
- Genetic testing – APOE-ε4 gene testing may be done for hereditary risk.  
4. Brain Imaging  
- MRI or CT Scan – Detects brain shrinkage.  
- PET Scan – Identifies amyloid plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s.
5. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis (in some cases)  
 - Measures levels of amyloid and tau proteins linked to AD

| Category | Effects |
|:--------:|:-------:|
|      Amyloid Plaques    |   Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) → disrupts neuronal communication & triggers immune response      |
|    Tau Tangles      |   Hyperphosphorylated tau detaches from microtubules → forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) → disrupts intracellular transport → neuronal dysfunction & apoptosis.      |
|     Neuroinflammation     | Microglial activation fails to clear plaques → releases inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) → chronic inflammation causes neuronal damage        |
|    Oxidative Stress & Mitochondrial Dysfunction      | Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired mitochondrial function → reduced ATP production, energy failure, and neuronal apoptosis        |
|   Neurotransmitter Deficiency       | Loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain → decreased acetylcholine (ACh) → impaired memory and learning. Glutamate dysregulation causes excitotoxicity, further damaging neurons        |
|     Synaptic & Neuronal Loss     |Progressive synapse loss & brain atrophy (hippocampus & cortex) → cognitive decline, impaired motor function, and eventual loss of vital functions.         |


### Treatment & Management Strategies
#### Medications
##### Cholinesterase inhibitors  
- Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that encodes and recalls memories in the hippocampus.  
- Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter.  
 - Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine.
- Cholinesterase inhibitors combat the decreased levels of acetylcholine from AD.  
- These medications prevent acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine

##### Memantine  
- Works by regulating the neurotransmitter glutamate
- Memantine helps improve cognitive function 
- Binds to NMDA receptors, which are involved in glutamate signalling.  
- Blocking these receptors, helps to reduce the overstimulation of glutamate and protect nerve cells from further damage.

##### Aducanumab and Lecanemab  
Recently approved  for early-stage AD monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid plaques in the brain to slow down cognitive declin

#### Non-pharmacological approaches  
##### Cognitive stimulation therapy  
Engaging in activities that stimulate cognitive functions, such as memory, problem-solving, and language.  
##### Reminiscence therapy  
Discussing past experiences and memories, often using prompts like photos or music, to improve mood and well-being.  
##### Behavioural therapies  
Helps manage behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with Alzheimer's, such as agitation, anxiety, and depression.  
##### Lifestyle modifications  
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social engagement can also help support brain health and potentially slow down the progression of Alzheimer's.

### Case Study  
A 63-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of repetitiveness, memory loss, and executive function loss beginning at age 58. This progressed to include word-finding difficulties, visuospatial skill decline, and impaired instrumental activities of daily living. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 14/30 at the initial visit, with poor verbal fluency, visuospatial, and executive skills. Brain MRI at age 58 showed mild generalized cortical atrophy. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) was made. Treatment included cholinesterase inhibitors, which initially improved her MMSE score to 18/30. Later, memantine was added due to further cognitive decline (MMSE=13/30). She died at age 63 of pneumonia. A post-mortem examination confirmed the EOAD diagnosis, revealing numerous plaques and tangles, congophilic amyloid  angiopathy, and Lewy Body pathology in the amygdala. Genetic testing, conducted three years before her death, identified a novel PSEN2 mutation (L221T) and an apolipoprotein E (apoE) ε3/4 genotype

# Week 6 Cardiovascular Disease

### CASE STUDY 
Mr Leon Brown, a 62-year-old male, presented at A&E with chest pain which started when he was running for a bus. Following a medical examination he was found to be overweight (body mass index 28 kg/m2), his blood pressure was 168/103 mmHg, and his total cholesterol levels 240 mg/dL (6.21 mmol/L). His ECG showed some signs of myocardial ischaemia, but no permanent cardiac damage. Mr Brown was diagnosed with stable angina and was offered lifestyle advice and support to help him lower his BP and cholesterol. He was prescribed GTN (to relieve chest pain), ramipril (to lower BP) and atorvastatin (to lower cholesterol). He was booked in for angiogram procedure to visualise the blood flow in the coronary arteries.

### Coronary Circulation  
- The heart gets blood through coronary arteries (from aorta)
If flow is reduced you get Angina Pectoris and if it stops you get Myocardial Infarction

Atherosclerosis in coronary arteries reduces flow

#### 3 pathologic stages  
1. The fatty streak  
- No symptoms  
2. Plaque progression  
- Angina  
3. Plaque disruption
 - myocardial infarction

##### The fatty streak  
Endothelial injury – leads to its dysfunction  
Physical stressors (E.g. high BP)  
Chemical stressors  (E.g. smoking or high cholesterol)  
![](https://i.imgur.com/QgVIQtb.png)

##### Plaque Progression  
![](https://i.imgur.com/y4A5Wrk.png)


### Angina Pectoris
- Chest pain  
	- Most common symptom  
	- Pain: dull, heavy, tight,  squeeze, or ache  
	- Radiates:  
		- Chest, arm or jaw  
- Associated with:  
	- SOB  
	- Sweating  
	- Nausea and vomiting

![](https://i.imgur.com/fIllMJQ.png)
Both cause [[myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]]

### Diagnosis  
#### Electrocardiogram - ECG  
ST segment depression Due to ischaemia  
His ECG showed some signs of [[myocardial ischaemia\|myocardial ischaemia]], but no permanent cardiac damage.

#### Stress testing -  exercise  
- Exercise on treadmill or cycle ergometer  
- HR, BP & ECG monitored  
- Aim for 85% of max HR  
- Positive test  
	- Angina pain develops  
	- Ischaemic signs on ECG  
		- ‘ST depression’  
	- STOP test!
##### Pharmacological and nuclear imaging
- Inject a coronary vasodilator  
	- Ischaemic regions already  maximally vasodilated so as other regions dilate they steal blood from the diseased areas  
	- Areas that are poorly perfused do  not get as much of the radionucleotide which is injected –  look like a ‘cold spot’ on the image  
- Inject a sympathomimetic  
	- Activates adrenergic receptors  
	- Increase force of contraction (inotropy) and heart rate (chronotropy) – mimics exercise  

### Risk Factors for Developing CAD - Aetiology  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2Y6FVgp.png)

#### Smoking  
\>1 pack a day increases the death rate from ischaemic heart disease by 200% through
-  modification of LDL  
- Endothelial dysfunction  
- platelet adhesiveness  
- Activation of sympathetic NS  
#### Obesity  
In the UK 1 in 6 deaths due to CVD are associated with a high body-mass index
#### High blood pressure  
5 x greater risk of IHD if BP >165/95 mmHg caused by
-  wall stress – endothelial damage  
-  foam cell formation  
-  retention of LDL in vessel wall  

#### Diabetes Mellitus  
- Adults with diabetes are more 2-3 times more likely to develop  
cardiovascular disease and People with diabetes are twice as likely to die from heart disease because of
-  modification of LDL for macrophage uptake by High glucose
-  foam cell formation  
- More prone to thrombosis  
- Endothelial dysfunction from damage by high blood glucose

### Treatment of CAD  
Treatment aims to:  
- Reduce disease progression  
- Improve myocardial blood flow (oxygen supply)  
- Reduce myocardial work (oxygen demand)  
- Match supply and demand

#### Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN)  
Formation of nitric oxide  
- Vascular smooth muscle relaxation  
- Causes dilation of arteries and veins  
- Reduces preload (myocardial O2 demand)  
- Dilate coronary vasculature   
- Incraese myocardial O2 supply

#### Preventative Treatment: Reduce risk factors  
- Angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors  
Enhances vasodilation and diuresis  
- Beta adrenergic receptors 
- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins)  
Lower cholesterol levels  

#### Surgical intervention: Angioplasty
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
- Blockage >50%  
- No response to other  treatment  
- Several arteries affected  

Method  
- Use a ‘spare’ vessel (E.g. Saphenous (leg) vein)  
- Internal mammary artery
