GM02. Risks associated with use of raw pet food in the home.
In recent years there has been a surge of raw pet food available on the market with raw food purported to have benefits to the health of the pet. However, given that many raw foods are usually made up of uncooked and minimally processed ingredients. Raw dog food primarily contains uncooked animal ingredients including raw meat, bones, organs, fruits, and vegetables.
Both the Food Standards Agency and FDA recognise the risk associated with this type of food and the increased risk when being stored alongside food for human consumption. This project will investigate the organisms that are present in this type of product and how it compares with traditional pet food. The effectiveness of guidelines from the FSA and FDA will also be investigated.

KEY SKILLS DEVELOPED: Research skills, experimental and technical (microbiology) skills, analytical and numerical skills, experimental design, independent and team-working, planning, and organisational skills, resilience.

IKR01 Investigation of antimicrobial activities of silver-loaded zeolites
To examine the antimicrobial efficiency of the zeolite polymers compared to conventional polymers and other silver-containing antimicrobials, for the inhibition of a range of microorganisms. Tests will be performed against suitable examples of microbes relevant to food hygiene, including infectious enteric bacteria, bacteria spoiling stored foods or/and fungal spores of a common mould species. Following the identification of antimicrobial activity, the project will try to identify molecular targets in the microbial cell, for example inhibition of key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis.

Dear Dr Manning,
I am an enthusiast of animal biology studying at Wolverhampton University. While looking through the documents for biological science I saw "GM02. Risks associated with use of raw pet food in the home" which I am interested in applying for. I am hoping that my attention to detail can be put to use throughout this opportunity.

The risks associated with use of raw pet food in the home caught my attention Because the idea that pet food should be enriching and safe for animals is surprisingly recent in the pet food industry with some pet foods advertising specifically that the food in question would be safe, although maybe not pleasant, for humans to eat. Of course, raw meat is sometimes argued to be better and sometimes argued to be worse for pets and why this is such a polarising opinion would be interesting from a pathological perspective and I am hoping that information I learn through this project can be applicable to ecotoxicology when I get to that stage.

Having earned my wings in the "principals of disease investigation in medical microbiology" without any assistance or guidance I have proven myself to be very reliable and capable of thinking logically. These attributes make it easy for me to commit to a well-made plan, the only thing I wish I did more was record more information for me to transform into data. Doing this could probably help with my writing projects going forth but more importantly would make me even more skilled at creating visualisations for any quantitative or qualitative results that I take down during the project. 

Thank you for reviewing my cover letter and CV, I am eagerly awaiting your reply so that I can begin discussing the future of this project.

Yours sincerely,
Dimitri Williams

Dear Prof. Iza Radecka i.radecka@wlv.ac.uk,

I am hoping that my attention to detail can be put to use throughout this opportunity.

The antimicrobial activities of silver-loaded zeolites caught my attention Because silver is antimicrobial by nature and sould be easier to source than themore conventional polymers that you would find. Of course, the precision that these zeolites could deliver is something that should be considered going forrward not just in this project but also in further projects as even if the efficacy of the silver-loaded zeolites is subpar, the specificity of them could make up for it in a controled environment. I am hoping that information I learn through this project can be applicable to ecotoxicology when I get to that stage.
