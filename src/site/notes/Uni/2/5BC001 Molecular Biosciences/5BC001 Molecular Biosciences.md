## DNA Replication
I wonder who discovered okazaki fragments
Two antiparallel strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between complimentary bases
### Types of DNA
![](https://i.imgur.com/etDqKWx.png)
#### B-DNA:  
- This is the most common form of DNA and the one most often depicted in textbooks and popular media.  
- Right-handed double helix.  
- Has about 10.5 base pairs (bp) per turn.  
- Major and minor grooves are well-defined
#### Supercoiled DNA:  
- This is a more compact structure that forms when the DNA helix is subjected to strain by being overwound or underwound.  
- Plays a role in the compaction of DNA in cells and also has implications in DNA replication and transcription.

### Enzymes Required for DNA Replication  
1. [[#DNA helicase]]
2. [[#Topoisomerase]]
3. [[#DNA Primase]]
4. [[#DNA Polymerase]] 
5. [[#DNA Ligase]]

#### DNA Primase 
synthesizes RNA primer to initiate DNA replication ( carried out by DNA Polymerse) 
- DNA polymerases require a free 3’OH group to add onto  
- Therefore DNA PRIMASE adds little RNA primers to the DNA (which  are later removed)
#### DNA Polymerase 
Synthesis of new strand of DNA complementary to the template DNA
DNA polymerase has exonuclease activity and cannot start polymerizing directly  
Primase has no self-correcting mechanism but can initiate polymerization... introduces many errors that are then removed by  
DNA Pol.
• A bacterium or eukaryotic cell has several different DNA  
polymerase enzymes  
• One DNA polymerase (a DNA replicase) undertakes  
semiconservative replication; the others are involved in repair  
reactions
Only one DNA polymerase is the  
replication enzyme.

##### DNA polymerase 5’->3’ direction  
• E. coli has Three types of polymerase  
• I mainly used for filling in small DNA segments during repair or  
replication (removed RNA primer (5’-3’ exonuclease)  
• II precise function unclear but may substitute for DNA  
polymerase I  
• III the main enzyme of DNA replication (5’-3’ Polymerase)

### Origin of replication
![](https://i.imgur.com/xkaYAWC.png)

DNA replication starts at specific locations: Origin of Replication in Eukaryotes
2 Key problems to overcome:  
• Replication must occur with extreme accuracy  
• Every nucleotide must be replicated only once  
Origins od replication in procaryotes have well  
defined consensus sequences, In eukaryotes they  
are less conserved
### Process of DNA Replication
1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Termination
#### Initiation
Replication initiates when a protein complex binds to  
the origin and “melts” the DNA there (opens up a  
replication bubble)

##### DNA helicase 
disruption of hydrogen bonds between the two strands and separate DNA by "unzipping” mechanism 

For DNA synthesis to proceed, the DNA double helix must be opened up (“melted”) ahead of the replication fork so  
that the incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates can form base pairs with the template strands. However, the DNA  
double helix is very stable under physiological conditions; the base pairs are locked in place so strongly that it requires  
temperatures approaching that of boiling water to separate the two strands in a test tube. For this reason, two  
additional types of replication proteins—DNA helicases and single-strand DNA-binding proteins—are needed to open  
the double helix and provide the appropriate single-strand DNA templates for the DNA polymerase to copy.  
DNA helicases use ATP to propel themselves rapidly along a  
DNA single strand. When they encounter a region of double  
helix, they continue to move along their strand, thereby prying  
apart the helix at rates of up to 1000 nucleotide pairs per  
second  
Helicase needs some single stranded DNA to get started  
This is provided by cdc6 and cdt1

##### Single-strand DNA-binding proteins AKA
Helix destabilizing proteins bind to the single stranded  
DNA behind helicase to prevent the DNA strands reforming double strands
This also prevents hairpins forming and  
Still allows DNA polymerase to recognize the individual basepairs:

##### Topoisomerase 
elimination of all the topological links  
between the two strands and to facilitate unwinding (swivel  
motion)  
topoisomerase I, produces a transient single-strand break; this break in the phosphodiester  
backbone allows the two sections of DNA helix on either side of the nick to rotate freely  
relative to each other, using the phosphodiester bond in the strand opposite the nick as a  
swivel point (Figure 5.21). Any tension in the DNA helix will drive this rotation in the  
direction that relieves the tension. As a result, DNA replication can occur with the rotation  
of only a short length of helix—the part just ahead of the fork.

#### Separate Eukaryotic DNA Polymerases undertake Initiation and Elongation
• A replication fork has one complex of DNA  
polymerase α/primase, one complex of DNA  
polymerase δ, and one complex of DNA  
polymerase ε.  
• The DNA polymerase α/primase complex  
initiates the synthesis of both DNA strands.  
• DNA polymerase ε elongates the leading  
strand and a second DNA polymerase δ  
elongates the lagging strand.

Idk Where this is supposed to go

#### Replisome: Bacterial Vs Eukaryote Names of Enzymes
![](https://i.imgur.com/pEN8t8s.png)

####  DNA Ligase
facilitates joining of DNA strands by formation  
of phosphodiester bonds
Following the removal or the RNA primer by DNA Pol I (5’-3’ exonuclease activity) DNA  
Ligase catalyses the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3’-hydroxyl group at  
the end of one DNA chain and the 5’-phosphoryl group at the end of another.
