we dont need to go over the concept of university
oh hes gonna do all of them....

## DNA Replication
I wonder who discovered okazaki fragments
Two antiparallel strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between complimentary bases
### Types of DNA
![](https://i.imgur.com/etDqKWx.png)
#### B-DNA:  
- This is the most common form of DNA and the one most often depicted in textbooks and popular media.  
- Right-handed double helix.  
- Has about 10.5 base pairs (bp) per turn.  
- Major and minor grooves are well-defined
#### Supercoiled DNA:  
- This is a more compact structure that forms when the DNA helix is subjected to strain by being overwound or underwound.  
- Plays a role in the compaction of DNA in cells and also has implications in DNA replication and transcription.

### Enzymes Required for DNA Replication  
1. [[#DNA helicase]]
2. [[#Topoisomerase]]
3. [[#DNA Primase]]
4. [[#DNA Polymerase]] 
5. [[#DNA Ligase]]

#### DNA Primase 
synthesizes RNA primer to initiate DNA replication ( carried out by DNA Polymerse) 
- DNA polymerases require a free 3’OH group to add onto  
- Therefore DNA PRIMASE adds little RNA primers to the DNA (which  are later removed)
#### DNA Polymerase 
Synthesis of new strand of DNA complementary to the template DNA
DNA polymerase has exonuclease activity and cannot start polymerizing directly  
Primase has no self-correcting mechanism but can initiate polymerization... introduces many errors that are then removed by  
DNA Pol.

### Origin of replication




# Terminology
##### DNA helicase 
disruption of hydrogen bonds between the  
two strands and separate DNA by "unzipping” mechanism  
##### Topoisomerase 
elimination of all the topological links  
between the two strands and to facilitate unwinding (swivel  
motion)  
##### DNA Ligase
facilitates joining of DNA strands by formation  
of phosphodiester bonds
