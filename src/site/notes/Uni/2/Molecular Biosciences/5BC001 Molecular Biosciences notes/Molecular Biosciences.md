## DNA Replication
![Pasted image 20251023055318.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251023055318.png)
Two antiparallel strands are held together by hydrogen bonding between complimentary bases
### Process
![Pasted image 20251023043655.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251023043655.png)
The double helix is unwound and the complementary strands are separated by the enzyme [[#helicase]], creating what is known as the [[#replication fork]]. Following this fork, [[#primase]] and [[#polymerase]] begin to act in order to create a new [[#Complimentary DNA|complimentary strand]]. 
These enzymes can only work in the 5' to 3' direction so once unwound: 
	The leading strand undergoes a continuous replication process— since it has 3' to 5' directionality, the polymerase assembling the leading strand can follow the replication fork without interruption. 
	The lagging strand cannot be created in a continuous fashion— because its template strand has 5' to 3' directionality—so the polymerase works backwards from the [[#DNA Replication fork|replication fork]] causing pauses in the process as the primase and polymerase move in the opposite direction of the fork. The enzymes stop and start again while the DNA helicase breaks the strands apart. Once the [[#okazaki fragments]] are made, DNA ligase connects them into a single, continuous strand. 
	
The entire replication process is considered "semi-discontinuous".


### Types of DNA Structure

| Repeating unit      | 1 bp         | 1 bp         | 2 bp        |

#### Supercoiled DNA:  
DNA supercoiling refers to the amount of twist in a particular DNA strand— which determines the amount of strain on it. A given strand may be "positively supercoiled" or "negatively supercoiled" (more or less tightly wound). The amount of a strand's supercoiling affects a number of biological processes, such as compacting DNA and regulating access to the genetic code . Certain enzymes, such as [[#topoisomerase]], change the amount of DNA supercoiling to facilitate functions. The amount of supercoiling in a given strand is in reference to "relaxed B-form" DNA. 
DNA becomes temporarily positively supercoiled when it is being replicated or transcribed
- This is a more compact structure that forms when the DNA helix is subjected to strain by being overwound or underwound.  
- Plays a role in the compaction of DNA in cells and also has implications in DNA replication and transcription.

### Enzymes Required for DNA Replication  
1. [[#helicase]]
2. [[#Topoisomerase]]
3. [[#Primase]]
4. [[#Polymerase]] 
5. [[#Ligase]]

##### helicase 
![DNA_Helicase_DNA_Replication.png](/img/user/images/DNA_Helicase_DNA_Replication.png)
Helicases are motor proteins that move incrementally along a nucleic acid strand, separating the two hybridized nucleic acid strands (via the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis.) 
##### Topoisomerase ![Catalytic_mechanisms_of_Topoisomerases.png](/img/user/images/Catalytic_mechanisms_of_Topoisomerases.png)
DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topological state of DNA, interconverting relaxed and supercoiled forms, linked (catenated) and unlinked species, and knotted and unknotted DNA.
bind to DNA and cut the sugar-phosphate backbone of either one (type I topoisomerases) or both (type II topoisomerases) of the DNA strands allowing the DNA to be untangled or unwound before the DNA backbone is resealed
<sub>Tension in a DNA helix will naturally be relived when the backbone is cut</sub>

#### Primase 
![Pasted image 20251023060418.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251023060418.png)
synthesizes RNA primer to initiate DNA replication ( carried out by DNA Polymerase) 
- DNA polymerase adds on to 3’
- Adds RNA primers to the DNA (which are later removed by [[#exonuclease]] tand replaced with DNA)
#### Polymerase 
Synthesis of new strand of DNA complementary to the template DNA
DNA polymerase has exonuclease activity and cannot start polymerizing directly
Primase has no self-correcting mechanism but can initiate polymerization... introduces many errors that are then removed by DNA Pol.
- A bacterium or eukaryotic cell has several different DNA polymerase enzymes  
- One DNA polymerase (a DNA replicase) undertakes semiconservative replication; the others are involved in repair reactions
Only one DNA polymerase is the replication enzyme.
![](https://i.imgur.com/AxFKKx0.png)
##### DNA polymerase 5’->3’ direction  
- E. coli has Three types of polymerase  
- I mainly used for filling in small DNA segments during repair or replication (removed RNA primer (5’-3’ exonuclease)  
- II precise function unclear but may substitute for DNA polymerase I  
- III the main enzyme of DNA replication (5’-3’ Polymerase)

####  Ligase
facilitates joining of DNA strands by formation of phosphodiester bonds 
Following the removal or the RNA primer by DNA Pol I (5’-3’ exonuclease activity) DNA Ligase catalyses the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 3’-hydroxyl group at the end of one DNA chain and the 5’-phosphoryl group at the end of another.

#### Exonuclease


### Origin of replication
![](https://i.imgur.com/xkaYAWC.png)

DNA replication starts at specific locations: Origin of Replication in Eukaryotes
2 Key problems to overcome:  
- Replication must occur with extreme accuracy  
- Every nucleotide must be replicated only once  
Origins od replication in procaryotes have well defined consensus sequences, In eukaryotes they are less conserved
### Process of DNA Replication
1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Termination
#### Initiation
Replication initiates when a protein complex binds to the origin and “melts” the DNA there (opens up a replication bubble)
![](https://i.imgur.com/YmUrSlx.png)



##### Single-strand DNA-binding proteins AKA
Helix destabilizing proteins bind to the single stranded DNA behind helicase to prevent the DNA strands reforming double strands This also prevents hairpins forming and Still allows DNA polymerase to recognize the individual basepairs:
![](https://i.imgur.com/mkrgGUL.png)



#### Separate Eukaryotic DNA Polymerases undertake Initiation and Elongation
- A replication fork has one complex of DNA polymerase α/primase, one complex of DNA polymerase δ, and one complex of DNA polymerase ε.  
- The DNA polymerase α/primase complex initiates the synthesis of both DNA strands.  
- DNA polymerase ε elongates the leading strand and a second DNA polymerase δ elongates the lagging strand.
For DNA synthesis to proceed, the DNA double helix must be opened up (“melted”) ahead of the replication fork so that the incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates can form base pairs with the template strands. However, the DNA double helix is very stable under physiological conditions; the base pairs are locked in place so strongly that it requires temperatures approaching that of boiling water to separate the two strands in a test tube. For this reason, two additional types of replication proteins—DNA helicases and single-strand DNA-binding proteins—are needed to open the double helix and provide the appropriate single-strand DNA templates for the DNA polymerase to copy. DNA helicases use ATP to propel themselves rapidly along a DNA single strand. When they encounter a region of double helix, they continue to move along their strand, thereby prying apart the helix at rates of up to 1000 nucleotide pairs per second Helicase needs some single stranded DNA to get started This is provided by cdc6 and cdt1
Idk Where this is supposed to go

| Sliding Clamp              | Beta/DNAN | PCNA                          |
| Sliding Clamp Loader       | T-Complex | RF-C                          |

### DNA Polymerase Makes mistakes at the replication fork  
- 1 per 100 thousand base pairs  
- But it can correct them!  
- Pol III has 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity (correcting as it goes)  
- Error rate now every billion base pairs (1 in every 109)  
- Pol II has 5’ to 3’ exonuclease activity (eg for removing RNA primer)
If the DNA polymerase did nothing when a mispairing occurred between an incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and the DNA template, the wrong nucleotide would often be incorporated into the new DNA chain, producing frequent mutations. The high fidelity of DNA replication depends not only on the initial base-pairing but also on several “proofreading” mechanisms. The error-correcting reaction, known as exonucleolytic proofreading, occurs immediately after an incorrect nucleotide is covalently added to the growing chain. DNA polymerase enzymes require a previously formed, base-paired 3ʹ-OH end of a primer strand to allow elongation. Those DNA molecules with a mismatched (improperly base-paired) nucleotide at the 3ʹ-OH end of the primer strand are not effective as templates because the polymerase has difficulty extending such a strand. DNA Pol correct such a mismatched primer strand by means of a separate catalytic site. This 3ʹ-to-5ʹ proofreading exonuclease clips off any unpaired or mispaired residues at the primer terminus, continuing until enough nucleotides have been removed to regenerate a correctly base-paired 3ʹ-OH terminus that can prime DNA synthesis.

Strand-directed mismatch repair Removes errors not fixed by DNA pol exonuclease:  
Identifies distortions in DNA caused by the presence of no-complimentary bases
![](https://i.imgur.com/nfdszzq.png)
Figure 5.19 Strand-directed mismatch repair. (A) The two proteins shown are present in both bacteria and eukaryotic cells:  
MutS binds specifically to a mismatched base pair, while MutL scans the nearby DNA for a nick. Once MutL finds a nick, it triggers the degradation of the nicked strand all the way back through the mismatch. Because nicks are largely confined to newly replicated strands in eukaryotes, replication errors are selectively removed. In bacteria, an additional protein in the complex (MutH) nicks unmethylated (and therefore newly replicated) GATC sequences, thereby beginning the process illustrated here. In eukaryotes, MutL contains a DNA nicking activity that aids in the removal of the damaged strand. (B) The structure of the MutS protein bound to a DNA mismatch. This protein is a dimer, which grips the DNA double helix as shown, kinking the DNA at the mismatched base pair. It seems that the MutS protein scans the DNA for mismatches by testing for sites that can be readily kinked, which are those with an abnormal base pair. (PDB code: 1EWQ.) Alberts Chapter 5

### Controlling the Direction of Mismatch Repair
- The mut genes code for a mismatch-repair system that deals with mismatched base pairs.  
- There is a bias in the selection of which strand to replace at mismatches  
 - The strand lacking methylation at a hemimethylated GATC/CTAG is usually replaced– because this is the “new” strand  
- This repair system is used to remove errors in a newly synthesized strand of DNA. At G-T and C-T mismatches, the T is preferentially removed.

### Spontaneous DNA base changes occur after polymeriza
The DNA of each human cell loses about 18,000 purine bases (adenine and guanine) every day because their N-glycosyl linkages to deoxyribose hydrolyze, a spontaneous reaction called depurination.  
Spontaneous deamination of cytosine to uracil in DNA occurs at a rate of about 100 bases per cell per day

#### Base dimerization
![](https://i.imgur.com/ytiItnx.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/CpT9k9P.png)

#### Base excision Repair (BER)  
Involves a battery of enzymes called DNA glycosylases. Each glycosylase recognize a specific type of altered base in DNA and catalyze its hydrolytic removal. There are at least six types of these enzymes, including those that remove deaminated Cs, deaminated As, different types of alkylated or oxidized bases, bases with opened rings, and bases in which a carbon–carbon double bond has been accidentally converted to a carbon–carbon single bond. an altered base detected by an enzyme-mediated “flipping-out” of the altered nucleotide from the helix, which allows the DNA glycosylase to probe all faces of the base for damage These enzymes travel along DNA using base-flipping to evaluate the status of each base. Once an enzyme finds the damaged base that it recognizes, it removes that base from its sugar DNA glycosylase enzymes recognizes specific inappropriate bases.  
Each enzyme cleaves the glycosyl bond that connects a particular recognized base (yellow) to the backbone sugar, removing it from the DNA.  
The “missing tooth” created by DNA glycosylase action is recognized by an enzyme called AP endonuclease (AP for apurinic or apyrimidinic, endo to signify that the nuclease cleaves within the polynucleotide chain), which cuts the phosphodiester backbone, after which the resulting gap is repaired by DNA Polymerase: Pol I in bacterial Pol β (beta), δ (delta) and ε (epsilon) in Eucaryotes
#### Nucleotide excision Repair (NER)  
Repairs the damage caused by almost any large change in the structure of the DNA double helix. Such “bulky lesions” include:  
Those created by the covalent reaction of DNA bases with large hydrocarbons (such as the carcinogen benzopyrene, found in tobacco smoke, coal tar, and diesel exhaust) Various pyrimidine dimers (T-T, T-C, and C-C) caused by sunlight. A large multienzyme complex scans the DNA for a distortion in the double helix, rather than for a specific base change. Once it finds a lesion, it cleaves the phosphodiester backbone of the abnormal strand on both sides of the distortion DNA helicase peels away the single-strand oligonucleotide containing the lesion. The large gap produced in the DNA helix is then repaired by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase
#### Excision Repair Systems in E. coli  
The term "Uvr" is derived from "UV radiation sensitive," as mutations in these genes render the bacteria more sensitive to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet
- The Uvr system makes incisions ~12 bases apart on both sides of damaged DNA, removes the DNA between them, and resynthesizes new DNA.
- incision : an endonuclease recognizes the damaged area in the DNA, and isolates it by cutting the DNA strand on both sides of the damage.
- excision : a 5’-3’ exonuclease removes a stretch of the damaged strand.
- Excision repair systems vary in their specificity, but share the same general features. Each system removes mispaired or damaged bases from DNA and then synthesizes a new stretch of DNA to replace them.
![](https://i.imgur.com/61y7njO.png)
In humans, the equivalent system to the Uvr-mediated nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway involves different and more numerous components than in prokaryotes.  
The main components involved in human NER:  
1. Damage Recognition:  
- XPC (in complex with RAD23B and CETN2) recognizes the DNA damage globally throughout the genome.  
1. Damage Verification: Once the damage is recognized, XPA verifies the presence of the damage and stabilizes the DNA around the lesion. RPA (replication protein A) also binds to the single-stranded DNA regions to stabilize them.  
2. DNA Unwinding: The TFIIH complex, which contains the helicases XPB and XPD, unwinds the DNA around the lesion to allow for incision.  
3. Incision: The endonucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG introduce cuts in the DNA strand containing the damage. XPF-ERCC1 makes the incision 5' to the lesion, and XPG makes the incision 3' to the lesion.  
4. Gap-filling and Ligation: After the removal of the damaged oligonucleotide, DNA synthesis fills in the gap, primarily by DNA polymerase δ or ε in conjunction with the replication factors RFC and PCNA. DNA ligase I or III then seals the nick, completing the repair.  
While the core process is similar to the prokaryotic Uvr system, the human NER pathway involves more proteins and is adapted to the complexities of the eukaryotic genome and chromatin structure.

![](https://i.imgur.com/d2NveZH.png)
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most deleterious types of DNA damage, as they can lead to large deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, and genome instability if not repaired correctly. Various factors and conditions can induce DSBs:  
5. **Ionizing Radiation**: Sources like X-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays can cause DSBs directly by breaking both DNA strands or indirectly by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that attack the DNA.  
6. **Chemical Agents**:  
- **Anticancer drugs**: Some chemotherapy agents, such as bleomycin, work by inducing DSBs in tumor cells.  
- **Topoisomerase II poisons**: Drugs like etoposide and doxorubicin stabilize the intermediate complex formed by topoisomerase II during its action on DNA, resulting in DSBs.  
1. **Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation**: While UV primarily induces pyrimidine dimers, if two closely spaced lesions are present on opposite DNA strands, they can be converted to DSBs during repair processes.  
2. **Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)**: By-products of cellular metabolism, especially during oxidative phosphorylation, ROS can attack DNA and generate various types of damage, including DSBs.  
3. **Replication Fork Collapse**: Obstacles to DNA replication, such as unrepaired DNA lesions or tightly bound protein complexes, can lead to stalling and subsequent collapse of replication forks, resulting in DSBs.  
4. **Mechanical Stress on DNA**: Overwinding or underwinding of DNA due to supercoiling can cause strain that leads to DSBs.  
5. **Retroviral Integration**: Some retroviruses integrate their DNA into the host genome, a process that can introduce DSBs.  
6. **Programmed DSBs in Meiosis**: DSBs are deliberately introduced during the early stages of meiosis to promote genetic recombination between homologous chromosomes.  
7. **Crispr-Cas Systems**: In genome-editing applications using the CRISPR-Cas system, the Cas nuclease introduces DSBs at specific genomic locations.  
If DSBs are not promptly and correctly repaired, they can lead to genomic rearrangements, mutations, and cell death. Fortunately, cells have evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms, such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, to manage and rectify DSBs.

#### Homologous Recombination (HR)  
This is the preferred method for repairing DNA double-strand breaks that arise shortly after the DNA has been replicated, while the daughter DNA molecules are still held close together.  
In general, homologous recombination can be regarded as a flexible series of reactions, with the exact pathway differing from one case to the next. For example, the length of the repair “patch” can vary considerably depending on the extent of 5ʹ processing and new DNA synthesis, indicated in green.one of the damaged strands can use the complementary strand of the intact DNA duplex as a template for repair.  
The ends of the broken DNA are chewed back, or “resected,” by specialized nucleases to produce overhanging, single-strand 3ʹ ends. The next step is strand exchange, during which one of the single-strand 3ʹ ends from the damaged DNA molecule worms its way into the template duplex and searches it for homologous sequences through base-pairing. Once stable base-pairing is established, a DNA polymerase extends the invading strand by using the information provided by the undamaged template molecule, thus restoring the damaged DNA. The last steps—strand displacement, further repair synthesis, and ligation—restore the two original DNA double helices and complete the repair process.  
Strand exchange is facilitated by a protein called RecA in E. coli and Rad51 in eukaryotes

## Tutorial analysis of transcription

### Introduction  
- Important insights into gene function can be gained by expression profiling, (which genes are switched on when).  
- In multicellular organisms such as plant species many genes are expressed in particular cell types or at certain developmental stages. Furthermore, mutating one gene can alter expression of others (master genes etc).  
- All this information helps to link genes into functional networks, and genes can be used as markers to define cellular states.
- Until quite recently, genes and their expression profiles have been studied one at a time. Therefore, defining networks has been almost impossible!  
- Since the mid 1990s technological advances have enabled us to study the expression profiles of thousands of genes simultaneously, culminating in global expression profiling where every gene in a particular genome is monitored in a single expt!!  
- This is performed at the RNA level (direct sequencing or DNA microarrays) or at the protein level ( by 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by aa sequencing).
- Global expression profiling produces a holistic view of cellular activity. Far different and more comprehensive than the 1970s to early 1990s technologies. However, some these older techniques are still of use today. Gene-by-gene techniques for expression analysis  
- Since the 1970s techniques have been available to monitor gene expression on an individual basis. Unfortunately, none of these techniques is particularly suited to global expression profiling these included:  
1) Northern blots/RNA dot blots  
2) RT-PCR  
3) Western blots  
4) Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
5) In situ hybridisation (See figures 1- 10 )  
- Although there were some techniques developed during the late 1980s that were used for parallel analysis of multiple genes e.g. differential hybridisation. These procedures were technically demanding and very labour intensive.  
- For true global analysis, new technology with a high degree of automation, which allowed thousands or tens of thousands of genes to be assayed simultaneously with minimal effort needed to be developed!

### Global analysis of RNA expression  
- The transcriptome - the full complement of RNA molecules produced by a particular genome (Veculescu et al, 1997).  
- Because of gene regulation the transcriptome is never observed as a complete system in vivo. There is no situation in which all the genes in the genome are simultaneously expressed.  
- All cells transcribe a basic set of housekeeping genes whose activity is required at all times for elementary functions, but other luxury genes are expressed in a regulated manner , e.g. as part of the developmental programme or in response to an external stimulus.
- Similarly, post-transcriptional events such as splicing are also regulated events. Therefore, researchers use phrases such as ‘human brain transcriptome’ or ‘plant zygotic transcriptome’ to emphasise this.  
- A typical human cell is thought to express ~ 20,000 different mRNAs, some of which have housekeeping functions and some of which are more specialised. A proportion of these will be splice variants of the same primary transcript. Some will be abundant, some rare.  
- So, for a truly global perspective of RNA expression all transcripts must be quantified at the same time. This requires a highly parallel assay format which is both sensitive and selective!
- There are currently two main types of strategy used for global RNA expression analysis  
1) Hybridisation analysis with comprehensive non-redundant collections of DNA sequences immobilised on a solid support. These are known as DNA arrays.  
2) Direct sampling of sequences from source RNA populations or cDNA libraries, or from sequence databases derived therefrom.

### DNA array technology  
- DNA array technology is the method of choice for high-throughput RNA expression analysis (Bowtell, 1999; Granjeaud et al, 1999). Arrays comprise a series of DNA elements arranged as spots (features) in a grid pattern on a solid support. These arrayed targets are hybridised (interrogated) with a complex probe I.e. a probe comprising many different sequences, which is prepared from an RNA population from a particular cell type or tissue.
- The composition of the probe reflects the abundances of individual transcripts in the source RNA population. Under the conditions used, the intensity of the hybridisation signal for each feature represents the relative level of the corresponding transcript in the probe.  
- The use of such arrays allows simultaneous measurement of the relative levels of many transcripts, and the only intrinsic limitation of the technique is the number and nature of sequences represented on the array.  
- Since 1997, whole genome arrays have been available for many model species, thus providing a truly global view of gene expression!

#### Spotted DNA arrays  
- A spotted DNA array is made by spotting cDNA or DNA clones (or PCR amplified DNA clones) onto a solid support where they are immoblised.  
- The first high-density cDNA arrays, now termed macroarrays, were essentially gridded cDNA libraries (Primrose et al, 2001).  
- cDNAs stored in a matrix format in microtitre plates were transferred to nylon membranes in a precise grid pattern, allowing rapid identification of the clones corresponding to positive hybridisation signals.

- For expression analysis complete libraries could be hybridised with complex probes generating a ‘fingerprint’ specific to a particular RNA source. Technology development  
- Nylon macroarrays are generally 10 or 20 cm2 in size and the feature density is low, with typically 1-2mm btwn targets (10-100 targets per cm2).This has some advantages: the arrays are easy to manufacture (cheap) and they are also easy to use because standard hybridisation procedures are applicable.
- For these reasons macroarrays are still made by a number of commercial suppliers and the technology for in-house array production is readily available, involving simple robotic devices or even handheld arrayers. However, as with all technology, macroarrays have several major disadvantages:  
1) The low feature density limits the number of sequences that can be interrogated simultaneously
2) hybridisation must be carried out in a large volume using a radioactive probe; the results being obtained by autoradiography.

#### The rise of the microarray!  
- A breakthrough in spotted array technology came with the development of microarrays on glass slides (Schena et al, 1995, 1996). Because glass is non-porous and has very little autofluorescence, fluorescent probes can be used and they can be applied in very small hybridisation volumes. The greater resolution afforded by fluorescent probes allows feature density to be increased and a smaller hybridisation volume improves the rxn kinetics.  
- Therefore, more features can be analysed simultaneously with the same amt of probe without loss of sensitivity.
- Thus, glass arrays can be made with 5000 features cm2. In addition, several different fluorophores can be used to label different RNA populations which can be hybridised to the microarray simultaneously, allowing differential gene expression btwn samples to be monitored directly (Shalon et al, 1996)!  
- The most common strategy is to use Cy3 and Cy5 labelled probes (explain).

#### Practical considerations in the manufacture of glass slide microarrays  
- When glass microarrays were first devised in the mid 1990s they had to be bought from a manufacturer and were single use and very expensive.  
- The clones used for different organisms varies: genomic clones tend to be used for bacterial arrays because of the lack of introns as is the case for yeasts. In higher eukaryotes, where introns are larger cDNAs are used the use of partial cDNA sequences that exploit the differences btwn related clones and helps avoid cross-hybridisation.
- Most of the cDNA information that exists in databases is in the form of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and these are a valuable resource for the manufacture of spotted arrays.  
- Fortunately, over the past few years the cost of producing and screening microarrays has begun to fall!  
- Microarray robots can now be built for £20, 000 and instructions for building arraying robots using simple and readily available components are available on the internet (see figure 16). Which will mean that this powerful technique is no longer beyond the reach of all but the most prestigious Universities.

#### Printed oligonucleotide chips  
- The alternative to a spotted DNA array is a high-density prefabricated chip. These are similar to DNA arrays in that they consist of gridded DNA targets which are interrogated by hybridisation. However, while DNA arrays consist of double-stranded clones or PCR products that may be up to several hundred base pairs in length, oligo chips contain single-stranded targets ranging from 25-70 nucleotides.  
- Oligo chips can be made in the same way as spotted DNA arrays, by robotically transferring chemically synthesised oligonucleotides from microtitre dishes to a solid support, where they are immobilised.
- However, the main advantage is that the max array density is increased up to ten fold if the oligos are printed directly onto the glass surface!

### Idk What "This" Is But Here Is Why Its Important
The focus is energy production through ATP  
The bonds between adenosine and phosphates are highly strained bonds  
So are a form of chemical potential energy

![Pasted image 20251127002329.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127002329.png)

### Mitochondria
• About the size of a bacterial cell (2 m)
• Aerobic respiration takes place to extract energy synthesising ATP 
• Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) occurs here

### The Electron Transport Chain
![Pasted image 20251009135919.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251009135919.png)
### Metabolic states
The integration of metabolism is revealed by looking at the processes that predominate when the organism is in extremis  
For metabolism these are the:  
•The fed state (0-4 hours after eating)  
•The fasted state (4-12 hours after  eating)  
•The starved state (12 hours and onwards without eating)
![Pasted image 20251127002709.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127002709.png)

![Pasted image 20251127002742.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127002742.png)
### Energy Storage  
• Carbohydrate = 4 calories/g, 
- Protein = 4 calories/g,  
• Fat = 9 calories/g
![Pasted image 20251127002859.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127002859.png)
![Pasted image 20251127002915.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127002915.png)• Carbohydrate = Stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle  
• Fat = Stored as triacylglycerol in the adipose tissue (small oil droplets)  
• Fat has more energy but is less efficient/readily used. NB: Heart primarily used beta-oxidation of  
fatty acids for energy as the O2 supply is high
### Metabolism of Lipids
![Pasted image 20251127003003.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003003.png)• A family of compounds that includes  
• Triglycerides (fats & oils)  
• Fats: lipids that are solid at room temperature  
• Oils: lipids that are liquid at room temperature  
• Phospholipids  
• Sterols (cholesterol).
### Structure of fatty acids
 Lipids exist primarily as fatty acids  
 Have different lengths but same basic structure
![Pasted image 20251127003140.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003140.png)
### Types of fatty acids
![Pasted image 20251127003200.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003200.png)
### Triglycerides
• Fatty acids are rarely free  molecules  
• Fatty acids are primarily stored  as fuel molecules In combination  with Glycerol  
• A triglyceride is formed when  one glycerol molecule joins with  three fatty acids to produce a triglyceride and water
![Pasted image 20251127003249.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003249.png)
![Pasted image 20251127003300.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003300.png)
Triacylglycerols (Fats) are non-soluble in H2O because they are non-polar
### Metabolism of dietary fat
• Triglycerides and cholesterol from the diet gets emulsified by bile acids in the intestine to form micelles  
• Bile acids are themselves made from cholesterol
![Pasted image 20251127003337.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003337.png)
• Once absorbed to the intestinal mucosa cells the fatty acids and monoacylglcerol are combined to re-form triacylglycerols and packaged into chylomicrons (lipoproteins)
![Pasted image 20251127003401.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003401.png)• While circulating in blood, chylomicrons exchange components with high-density  
lipoproteins (HDL). The HDL donates apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) and  
apolipoprotein E (APOE) to the nascent chylomicron and, thus, converts it to a  
mature chylomicron  
• Upon arrival in adipose tissue and muscle cells, lipoprotein lipase cleaves the  
triacylgycerols to free fatty acids and glycerol  
• Fatty acids are taken up by these tissues and glycerol is transported to liver or  
kidneys
  
• Re-esterification occurs whenever fatty acids are needed in other parts of the body
![Pasted image 20251127003436.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003436.png)
• Insulin and glucagon play key roles in lipid metabolism
#### Insulin  
• Reduces blood glucose levels  
• Increase liver glycogen synthesis  
• Increases glycolysis  
• Increase glucose uptake in  peripheral tissues  
• Increase amino acid uptake and  protein synthesis  
• inhibits protein breakdown  
• Increases lipogenesis  
• inhibits lipolysis  
#### Glucagon  
• Stimulates glycogen breakdown  
• Stimulates gluconeogenesis  
• Stimulates protein breakdown  
• Inhibits lipogenesis  
• Activates lipolysis and ketone  synthesis
### Adipose tissue depot
Subcutaneous fat  
• is formed from the mesoderm.  
• Required for fat storage and  insulation than visceral fat  
• Now known to have many secreted  adipokines  
 Viscera Fat  
• Endocrine organ which releases  adipokines
![Pasted image 20251127003540.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003540.png)
### Fat cells and  endocrinology
• Fat cells are part of the endocrine  system  
• Hormones are chemical messengers  released from one tissue, carried in the circulation & producing a specific,  receptor-mediated change in another tissue
![Pasted image 20251127003636.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003636.png)
### Adipose derived hormones
• Leptin and adiponectin  
• Leptin (increased in obesity, central and  
peripheral effects; causes negative  
outcomes)  
• Adiponectin (decreased in obesity  
therefore you lose the beneficial effects  
you would normally see).
![Pasted image 20251127003700.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003700.png)
### Adiponectin
 244 amino acid protein with several  
domains.  
• Secretion is caused by and correlates  
with insulin levels  
• Adiponectin is REDUCED with obesity  
and promotes INSULIN SENSITIVITY.  
• Thought to promote glucose uptake (in  
muscle) and inhibit gluconeogenesis  
(liver) whilst promoting fatty acid  
oxidation (in both). Similar,  
complementary (and often additive)  
effects to leptin.
![Pasted image 20251127003731.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003731.png)
### Leptin
16kDa (166 amino acids) protein  
• Important roles in METABOLISM and FEEDING  
• A random mouse mutation of the leptin gene  (Jackson labs in the 50s) was massively obese  
• acts on tyrosine kinase receptors in the  hypothalamus with many physiological,  
anorectic effects  
• Increased in obesity with central and  peripheral effects.. obese people are less  
sensitive to leptin and therefore have less of a  satiety signal
![Pasted image 20251127003802.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127003802.png)
### Other adipose hormones
• Resistin – 118 aa cys-rich secreted protein.  
Correlates with obesity. Possible role in T2DM  
• Visfatin – enzyme in high levels in obesity and  
visceral fat. Possibly insulin-sensitising.  
• Chemokines – Many are also adipokines

## Mutation and Disease
• A permanent change in DNA sequence.
• Results in a functional change in a gene product.
• The gene product is usually a protein.
• To be effective, mutations must alter protein
encoding or control regions.
• SOME gene products are non-coding RNAs,
mutations can also affect these.
• Genes can be mutated by many different
mechanisms, ranging from single base substitution
to a large-scale chromosomal disruption.
### Not all genes code for proteins: Non-coding RNAs
Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) : Reglulate pre-mRNA splicing  
Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA): Regulating RNA biogenesis  
Ribonuclease P (RNase P) : A Ribozyme (enzyme) active digests pre tRNA to mature tRNA  
RNase MRP : A Ribozyme (enzyme) rRNA processing, mDNA replication  
Telomerase RNA component (TERC): Adds telomere ends (in conjunction with a protein)  
Long noncoding RNA (long ncRNA): Gene expression regulation  
MicroRNA (miRNA) : Regulation of gene expression by mRNA degradation  
Vault RNAs (vRNA) : contained inside Vaults (large protein structures!)Drug metabolism
### The consequence of mutations
Mutations occurring in the germ cells are heritable,  
and may lead to a genetic disease in the offspring
• Mutations occurring in the somatic or body cells are not  
inherited.  
• Mutations which interfere with normal cell differentiation  
and/or proliferation can lead to tumour formation.  
• Defence against tumour formation:  
Accumulation of mutations contributes to cell senescence  
or death
Accumulation of mutations contributes to cell senescence or death
![Pasted image 20251127004334.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127004334.png)
• Accumulation of mutations contributes to cell senescence or death
### The effect of a mutagenic hit to the DNA on a cell
Several options:  
• DNA repair systems detect and repair the  
damage to that cell: the mutation is not  
passed on to daughter cells  
• The cell cannot function and dies: again, the  
mutation is not passed on  
• The mutation is not detected (or can’t be  
repaired by the cell), the cell replicates, and  
the mutation is passed on to daughter cells
![Pasted image 20251127004407.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127004407.png)
Mutation rate : 1 in 30 million nucleotides  
(Xue Y et al. (2009) Human Y chromosome base substitution mutation rate  
measured by direct sequencing in a deep-rooting pedigree. Current Biology 19,  
1453–1457)  
3164.7million bp per human genome  
(The human genome project)  
<2% of genome codes for protein (aprox. 63 million nucleotides)  
(The human genome project)  
Therefore: 105 base changes per cell division  
Therefore: aprox. 2 coding base changes per cell division.  
Many of these will be silent.

### SRY: Sex-determining Region Y Gene  
In Females one X chromosome is condensed, preventing most genes being expressed.  
BUT, some regions are relaxed and genes are expressed
### Types of mutation  
Small scale and single base (point) mutations:
• A point mutation changes a single DNA base
• Base substitutions
– transition: purine (A or G) -> purine
pyrimidine (C or T) -> pyrimidine
T->C C->T A->G G->A
– transversion: purine -> pyrimidine
pyrimidine-> purine
T->G T->A C->G C->A
A->T A->C G->T G->C

Gross Mutations: Translocations
![Pasted image 20251127004836.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127004836.png)
#### How do chromosomal translocations occur
Translocations occur as a consequence of inappropriate crossing oveR
![Pasted image 20251127005301.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005301.png)
##### Consequences of translocation in inherited disease
• Often, balanced translocations have no phenotype  
• Some balanced translocations disrupt single genes:
![Pasted image 20251127005405.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005405.png)
• Reading frame of both genes destroyed or  
• Fusion protein produced or/and  
• Transcription enhancers in inappropriate location
• Incorrect promoters/ enhancers change the level of gene regulation
Unbalanced translocations can result in an extra copy of many genes
![Pasted image 20251127005457.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005457.png)
### What causes mutations
![Pasted image 20251127005704.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005704.png)
Chemical mutagens: Deamination (induced by HNO2, nitrous acid)
![Pasted image 20251127005729.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005729.png)
![Pasted image 20251127005800.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005800.png)
Chemical mutagens: Alkylating agents  
add an alkyl group (CH3-, CH3CH2-) to a base, causing  
base substitutions or strand breakage
![Pasted image 20251127005942.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005942.png)
![Pasted image 20251127005957.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005957.png)

DNA POL has 3’-5’ exonuclease activity: This removes inappropriately paired bases:

![Pasted image 20251127010034.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010034.png)

#### Mechanisms of mutation: C ->  T at CpG
• High frequency of C-> T transitions in the genome, especially at CpG  
dinucleotides:  
– C-G to T-A transition mutations account for 30-40% of  
all point mutations  
• Cytosines at CpG are frequently methylated; spontaneous deamination of 5-  
methyl-cytosine to thymine  
• Mutation rate at CpG is 8.5 times that of other dinucleotides  
– frequent nonsense mutation is CGA -> TGA, R -> X
![Pasted image 20251127005903.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127005903.png)

### Point Mutation sub-types:
• Missense mutation: replaces one amino acid with  
another (Non-synonymous).  
### The Genetic code
![Pasted image 20251127010136.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010136.png)
Third base-pair wobble / Degenerative bases  
Often a missense @ the 3rd base in a codon does not change amino acid.  
(Synonymous change  
AKA: Silent polymorphism)

### Frameshift Mutations
Insertion or deletion of 1 or 2 (not 3) base pairs
This can lead to either a truncated protein, or loss of the aberrant  
transcript through a surveillance process called “nonsense mediated decay”  
The part of protein C-terminal to the site of the mutation is changed extensively

### Non-Frameshift insertions or deletions
nsertion or deletion of 3 bases or bases in multiples of 3 only affect the area of the  
protein coded for by that region.
### Nonsense Mutations
eplace a codon specifying an amino acid with a stop  
codon (“X”)  
genome has TAA, TAG and TGA as stop codons
![Pasted image 20251127010256.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010256.png)
Nonsense-mediated decay often prevents the formation of truncated proteins by degrading  
Nonsense mRNA.
#### Nonsense-mediated decay
NMD prevents the synthesis of truncated proteins from transcripts containing errors  
In particular frameshift/ nonsense mutations.

• Missense, nonsnese and frameshift mutations can affect the  
coding portions of the genes.  
• Other point mutations/ insertions/deletions can affect the  
control regions (promoters/ Enhancers)  
or intron/exon splicing junctions.

### Mutation nomenclature: examples of CFTR mutations  
(cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)
![Pasted image 20251127010447.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010447.png)
### Disease causing point mutations (and small insertion/deletions):
#### Cystic fibrosis
Autosomal recessive disease - incidence: 1 in 2000-3000  
• Predominantly Caucausian populations.  
• Carrier frequency 1 in 22-28  
• Monogeneic disease (mutations in 1 gene)  
• Gene: CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator)  
• Protein: A regulated epithelial Chloride channel (influences other ion channels)
![Pasted image 20251127010528.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010528.png)
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)
CFTR is the main chloride channel in epithelia of various tissues.  
epithelia perform diverse functions:  
1) water or volume-absorbing (airways and intestinal tract)  
2) salt-absorbing (sweat duct, lung)  
3) water or volume-secretory (pancreas, lung)  
all processes involve chloride ion transport.  
disruption of this transport in cystic fibrosis leads to multiple effects  
Protein: CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane  
conductance regulator)
![Pasted image 20251127010607.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010607.png)
##### Heterogeneity of DNA mutations: cystic fibrosis
• The occurrence of different mutations within the  
same gene  
• May have very different effects on the function of the  
encoded protein  
• Often a “spectrum” of severity, from very severe to  
relatively mild, giving a variation in the clinical  
phenotype  
– may allow a “genotype-phenotype correlation” to be made:  
relates the type of mutation to the disease severity or  
prognosis  
– eg. the different mutations in the cystic fibrosis  
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein

## The Cell Cycle
The only way to make a new cell is to  
duplicate a cell that already exists:
![Pasted image 20251127010725.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010725.png)
• A cell reproduces by performing an orderly sequence of events in which it  
duplicates its contents and then divides in two.  
• Fundamentally important in this process is the successful passing on of its  
genetic information to the next generation of cells:
![Pasted image 20251127010852.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127010852.png)
In addition to genome duplication cells also have to duplicate everything else (organelles  
and macromolecules)
The cell cycle must:  
1) Duplicate accurately all the DNA in chromosomes:  
S-phase (DNA Synthesis-phase)  
2) Segregate the chromosomes accurately into two daughter cells:  
M-phase (Mitosis-phase)
![Pasted image 20251127011004.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011004.png)
![Pasted image 20251127011057.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011057.png)
#### The Eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into Four Phases:
• Most cells require more time to grow and replicate organelles and double their mass than  
they require to replicate their chromosomes.  
• The cell cycle has 2 GAP-PHASES:  
These allow sufficient time for cells to grow  
AND the points at which cells monitor their  
Internal and external environment  
• G1 phase is the main point at which the cell  
monitors external conditions.  
• If conditions are unfavorable the cell will not  
enter S-Phase. Instead they enter a phase called  
G0 or Quiescence.  
• Many cells remain in G0- Quiescent for  
many years (doing their correct job in a tissue)  
Once the cell cycle progresses past a commitment point (The restriction point) DNA  
replication cannot be stopped  
• G2 Phase is the main point at which the cell monitors for errors in DNA replication
![Pasted image 20251127011131.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011131.png)
• Normal, mammalian somatic cells can only divide for a finite number of times:
Mutations in a single gene may be sufficient to induce premature senescence or  
apoptosis
How can we tell what phase of the cell cycle a cell is in?  
When cells are observed by microscopy v. few are seen in mitosis or cytokinesis
Determine S-Phase cells by incorporation of Thymidine Base-analogue: Bromo-deoxyuridine
Fix gut cells and apply an anti-BrdU  
Antibody to visualize cells  
replicating their DNA (Green).  
(All cells are counterstained red)
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or Flow cytometry
![Pasted image 20251127011250.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011250.png)
you can apply BrdU to cells in culture for a short perioud of time (a pulse-label)  
And follow the BrdU through cell cycle compared to total DNA to measure the time it  
takes for cells to complete a full cell cycle.
#### How is the cell cycle controlled?
A connected series of biochemical switches:  
Each initiates a specific cell cycle event.  
1) Switches are generally binary: ON/OFF  
• Once switched: irreversible  
• (what would happen if DNA replication started but did not  
finish!)  
2) Very reliable- a lot of back-up mechanisms/redundancy in the  
system  
3) Very adaptable- can be modified to suit specific cell types or  
respond to specific signals.
#### The cell cycle control system triggers cell cycle progression at 3 major regulatory transitions (CHECKPOINTS)
The cell cycle control system triggers cell cycle progression at  
3 major regulatory transitions (CHECKPOINTS)
![Pasted image 20251127011421.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011421.png)
#### Central to Cell cycle is controlled is the combinations of two  
protein types:
![Pasted image 20251127011436.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011436.png)
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) are inactive until they bind to an appropriate partner cyclin:
CDK protein levels remain constant within a cell.  
Cyclin levels vary in concentration (cycle) with different phases of the cell cycle.
##### The cell cycle control system is regulated by the activation of  Cyclin-dependent kinases
![Pasted image 20251127011529.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011529.png)
![Pasted image 20251127011541.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011541.png)

### Mitogens, receptors and cellular signaling
#### Control of (G0)G1/S-phase transition
Cells in G0 do not express any cyclins (CDKs are present but inactive).  
Mitogens stimulate cell division by inducing the expression of Cyclin D and Cyclin E
Mitogens are proteins secreted from other cells  
(usually neighboring cells) there are >50 known mitogens:  
Examples:  
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF):  
wound healing, stimulates many different cell types to  
divide.  
Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF):  
Stimulates many different cell types to divide.  
Erythropoietin:  
Stimulates red blood cell precursor division.
Growth inhibitory molecules inhibit the activity of  
mitogens  
E.G.:  
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFb)  
Blocks cell cycle in G1 OR induced Apoptosis.
![Pasted image 20251127011722.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011722.png)
#### Mitogens bind to cell surface receptors:
![Pasted image 20251127011743.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011743.png)
#### Mitogens bind to Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)
![Pasted image 20251127011817.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011817.png)
RTKs phosphorylate specific tyrosine amino acids on themselves (autophosphorylation)
Mitogens are ligands for Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)  
Once bound they cause dimerization of the receptor components , bringing the kinase  
domains together, allowing auto-phosphorylation (AKA: cross-phorylation) at multiple  
tyrosine sites:
![Pasted image 20251127011842.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011842.png)
Phosphorylated RTK change conformation, allowing the binding of intracellular  
signaling proteins:
![Pasted image 20251127011904.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011904.png)
The intracellular signaling proteins that bind  
to TRK such as EGFR contain SH2 domains  
(Src homology region)  
SH2 domains allow these proteins to bind.
#### Binding of SH2 domain adaptor proteins to activated RTK activates the RAS GTPase
Q. What is RAS  
A: A monomeric GTPase  
RAS is active when it is bound to Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)  
RAS is Inactive when it is bound to Guanosine diphosphate (GDP)  
RAS is activated by Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)  
GEFs exchange GDP for GTP!  
(GEFs are activated by binding to SH2 adaptor proteins!)![Pasted image 20251127011956.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127011956.png)
![Pasted image 20251127012015.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012015.png)
1: binding of Ligand (EGF) to receptor (EGFR) causes a conformational change and auto  
phosphorylation.  
2: A SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein (eg. Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2  
(GRB2)) can bind to the activated receptor. This then bind and activate a Guanine nucleotide  
exchange factor (GEF).  
3: The activated GEF replaces a GDP for a GTP in RAS, RAS is now activated and can continue  
the signaling cascade.

### G1 to S-phase switchCyclins, CDKs, pRB and E2F
Once the cyclin D gene is switched on, cyclin D protein accumulates and binds to CDK4 and CDK6
![Pasted image 20251127012126.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012126.png)
The main target for cyclinD/CDK4/6 is the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb):  
pRB is found in the nucleus bound to a transcription factor called E2F  
pRB inhibits E2F from binding to the promoter of its target genes
![Pasted image 20251127012144.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012144.png)
![Pasted image 20251127012150.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012150.png)
E2F switches on genes that are needed to proceeded from G1 to S-phase.  
Before it can do this it must escape from pRB:![Pasted image 20251127012258.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012258.png)
![Pasted image 20251127012306.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012306.png)
Active cyclin D-CDK4/6 inhibits RB resulting release of E2F transcription factor  
E2F binds to the promoter of Cyclin E and Cycin A  
Active cyclin E-CDK2 further inhibits RB releasing even more E2F, resulting in the expression of  
more Cyclin A:  
Entry into S=-phase
![Pasted image 20251127012327.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012327.png)
Q. How is cyclin E degraded in S-phase?  
A. i) E2F induces the expression of a cyclin/CDK inhibitor: p27  
ii) cyclin E is targeted for protesomal degerdation by ubiquitination
Induction of p27 by E2F inhibits cyclin D and cyclin E activity resulting in reduced Cyclin E  
Expression:
![Pasted image 20251127012353.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012353.png)
![Pasted image 20251127012401.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012401.png)
To ensure rapid removal of cyclin E at S-phase a complex of 3 proteins target it for destruction  
by the proteasome  
Skip1  
Cul1 (Cullin)  
F-box  
Collectively, these are known as the SCF complex
![Pasted image 20251127012434.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012434.png)
Proteasomes are found in the cytoplasm and nucleus  
They degrade proteins with polyubiquitin tails:
![Pasted image 20251127012448.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012448.png)
### S-Phase
2 Key problems to overcome:  
• Replication must occur with extreme accuracy  
• Every nucleotide must be replicated only once  
DNA replication occurs at origins of replication:
#### Timing of DNA replication in S-phase
![Pasted image 20251127012517.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012517.png)
#### The prereplicative complex (pre-RC)
![Pasted image 20251127012552.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012552.png)
#### The replication origin is ready to fire!  
(Before it can Cyclin A must accumulate)
![Pasted image 20251127012617.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012617.png)
![Pasted image 20251127012626.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012626.png)
#### Mitosis
![Pasted image 20251127012649.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012649.png)
#### The activity of Cyclin B-Cdk 1 regulates Mitosis
![Pasted image 20251127012708.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012708.png)
P300 is a coactivator of transcription at the cyclin B gene  
Cyclin D-CDK inhibits p300  
Cyclin A-CDK activates p300  
As the cell cycle progresses increasing levels of cyclin A results in an up-regulation of cyclin B  
from the middle of S-phase.
Cyclin B-cdk1 requires activating:  
• Cdk activating kinase (CAK) phospohrylates cdk1 to activate it  
• But an overriding inhibitory phosphorylation is laid down by Wee1  
• The activity of a phosphatase, cdc25 activates cyclin B-cdk1 (cdc25 is initially activated by  
Cyclin A-cdk).  
• Once cyclin B-cdk1 is active it induces a +ve feedback loop to further activate cdc25 and  
inactivate wee1
![Pasted image 20251127012742.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012742.png)
#### The activity of Cyclin B-Cdk 1 regulates Mitosis
Cyclin B-cdk1 induces:  
Chromosome condensation  
Mitotic spindle formation  
Breakdown of the nuclear envelope  
Rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and Golgi apparatus  
Each of these processes is triggered by cyclin B-cdk1  
phosphorylation of a specific proteins involved in the  
process.  
Many of these proteins have yet to be identified
At Anaphase, cyclin B (and all other cyclins) is degraded by the anaphase promoting  
complex (AKA the cyclosome)(APC/C)
APC/C is a ubiquitin ligase:  
• Cyclin B-cdk activates CdC20  
• Cdc20 activates APC/C  
• APC/C targets all cyclins for destruction:  
APC/C is a ubiquitin ligase:  
• APC/C targets securin for destruction  
• This leads to the activation of seperase  
• Seperase is an enzyme that cuts cohesin/Kleisin  
• That keeps sister chromosomes together during early mitosis
APC/C remains active in the new daughter cells  
Until, following mitogenic stimuli G1 cyclins accumulate and inactivate it
### The cell cycle machinery and cancer
The cell cycle control system functions as a network of Biochemical switches:
![Pasted image 20251127012943.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127012943.png)
If DNA is damaged the double-strand break is recognized by ATM/ATR proteins  
This results in activation of p53:
![Pasted image 20251127013001.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127013001.png)
If DNA damage is very severe p53 switches on apoptosis inducing proteins
![Pasted image 20251127013030.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127013030.png)
Receptor amplification results in auto-activation  
And permanent G1 cyclin-cdk activity :
![Pasted image 20251127013049.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127013049.png)
ow do receptor gene amplifications occur?  
1) Aneuploidy : incorrect number of chromosomes)  
2) Translocation: places a strong promoter in front of  
receptor gene
![Pasted image 20251127013117.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251127013117.png)




# Terminology
###### Replication fork
The replication fork is a structure that forms within the long helical DNA during DNA replication. It is produced by enzymes called helicases that break the hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA strands together in a helix. The resulting structure has two branching "prongs", each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template.![Pasted image 20251023044620.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020251023044620.png)

###### okazaki fragments
short sequences of DNA nucleotides which are synthesized discontinuously and later linked together by the enzyme DNA ligase to create the lagging strand during DNA replication
![Okazaki_fragment_EN.svg.png](/img/user/images/Okazaki_fragment_EN.svg.png)
###### Complimentary DNA
Complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA that was reverse transcribed (via [[#reverse transcriptase]]) from an RNA (e.g., mRNA or miRNA). cDNA exists in both single-stranded and double-stranded forms and in both natural and engineered forms. 

###### microRNA
Micro ribonucleic acid (microRNA, miRNA, μRNA) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules containing 21–23 nucleotides.[1] Found in plants, animals, and even some viruses, miRNAs are involved in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.[2][3] miRNAs base-pair to complementary sequences in messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules,[4] then silence said mRNA molecules by one or more of the following processes:[1][5]
    Cleaving the mRNA strand into two pieces.
    Destabilizing the mRNA by shortening its poly(A) tail.
    Reducing translation of the mRNA into proteins.

In cells of humans and other animals, miRNAs primarily act by destabilizing the mRNA.[6][7]
