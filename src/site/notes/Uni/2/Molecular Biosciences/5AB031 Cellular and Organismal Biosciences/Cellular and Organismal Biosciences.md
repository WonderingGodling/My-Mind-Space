The Plant Extracellular Matrix
Introduction
- All plant species are covered by the plant cell wall
that forms a single continuous extracellular matrix
(ECM) throughout the body of the plant (See Figure 1)
- The structure/composition of this ECM has clear
agronomic/economic importance in relation to the
food, textile and timber/paper industries.
Figure 1: Hibiscus rosa-sinensis stigmatic papillae.
(Baldwin(Baldwin et al,et al, unpublished).unpublished).
- The plant ECM consists of a number of major
interactive molecular components which interact with
both intrinsic and extrinsic proteins of the plasma
membrane and these in turn interact directly or
indirectly with the actin filaments and microtubules of
the cortical cytoskeleton.
- All these elements together constitute the plant cell
surface and it is this CELL SURFACE that is at the
heart of many key events in plant growth and
development.
- The structure and function of the plant ECM has
important implications for cell signalling and
communications, the rate and direction of cell growth, and
the organisation of cellular events at the tissue level.
- Therefore, only by analysing the synthesis, architecture
and interactions between the component parts of this
structure can we hope to understand its role in the
aforementioned processes in agronomically important
species.
The structure of the plant ECM
- Plant cells deposit their cell walls as a series of
layers.
(a) Middle lamella: Earliest formed layer located at the
centre of a double wall formed by two adjacent cells.
This is derived from the cell plate laid down at cell division.
This layer of the ECM is extremely pectin-rich.
(See Figures 2).
Figure 2: Cell plate formation.
(Brett and Waldron, 1996).(Brett and Waldron, 1996).
1μm
(b) Primary cell wall: Once the cell plate is complete and
the middle lamella has been formed, the daughter cells
proceed to deposit what is termed the primary cell wall.
This is deposited continuosly whilst a cell is increasing
in volume and is 0.1 - 1.0μmthick.
(c) Secondary cell wall: Most plant cells only possess a
middle lamella and a primary cell wall, but certain
specialised cells such as sclerenchyma cells (eg: stone
cells) proceed to lay down a third layer after the cell has
ceased to grow termed the secondary cell wall is often
to strengthen and rigidify the cell and is lignin-rich.
(See figures 3, 4 & 5).

(stone cell) example of cell type which possesses a
secondary cell wall.

Figure 5: Cell wall architecture compared with
the structure of plywood.
- It is important to note that the composition of the
cell walls in different plant species and within different
tissues and organs of an individual species differ widely
(See figure 6)
- Since the primary cell wall is the most important
layer of the ECM in relation to plant/growth and
development I shall limit the remainder of this lecture to
a discussion of this structure.

cell walls (a) fruit & veg (b) cereal endosperm (C) cereal bran

The Primary cell wall
Cellulose: (β 1, 4- Glucan)
Hemicelluloses: xylan, glucomannan, mannan,
galactomannan, xyloglucan and arabinogalactan.
Pectins: Rhamnogalactan I, arabinan, galactan,
arabinogalactan I, homogalacturonan.
Proteins:
(I) Structural proteins
Arabinogalactan-proteins, proline-rich proteins,
glycine-rich proteins, extensins and solanaceous lectins.
(ii) Enzymes Which function to modify the structure of
specific cell wall components.
THE STRUCTURE OF THE PRIMARY CELL WALL
- The primary cell wall of the majority of plant
species consists of three major interactive components:
(a) The cellulose/xyloglucan network (scaffolding)
(b) The pectin/hemicellulose network (matrix)
(C) The structural protein network (matrix)
(See figure 7)
Figure 7: Scale model of onion primary cell wall
(McCann and Roberts, 1991)
Polysaccharide Components of the
Primary Cell Wall
Structure and function of cellulose
- Cellulose, an unbranched β 1,4-glucan in a linear
form, is the major component of the primary cell wall
and comprises 20-30% of the walls’ dry weight.
- The chains of cellulose self associate into
structures termed microfibrils that have a diameter
5-15 nm and are elliptical in cross-section.
- Cellulose is a component of all higher plant cell
walls, but the “matrix” components (pectins,
hemicelluloses and proteins) differ widely between
(graminaceous monocots) and (dicots+non gram. monocots).
- The matrix components of the former are
characterised by low levels of pectin, xyloglucan and
structural protein, and high levels of arabinoxylans
and β-1-3, 1-4-glucans. The reverse is true of dicots+
non-graminaceous monocots.
Proposed functions
- Binds to the hemicellulose xyloglucan to form the
cellulose/xyloglucan network of the primary cell wall that
forms the ‘scaffolding’ of the wall, around which the
‘matrix’ polysaccharides and structural proteins are
deposited (See figure 8).
Figure 8: EM replica of cellulose/XG in onion primary cell wall
(McCann(McCann et alet al, 1990), 1990)
200 nm
Hemicellulose
- Hemicellulose is the term used to describe all
non-cellulosic polysaccharides other than pectin.
- Xyloglucan is the most abundant hemicellulose
in dicots and non-graminaceous monocots.
- The backbone of xyloglucan is identical to cellulose,
but attached to 70-80% of the glucose residues are side
chains, mostly of xylose residues linked to glucose.
Proposed function:
- Purified xyloglucans associate strongly in vitro with
purified cellulose. In the wall it seems that they stick to
microfibrils by hydrogen bonding between the cellulose
molecules to form the cellulose/XG network. (See figure 9).
Figure 9: Xyloglucan binding to cellulose.
(Brett and Waldron, 1996)
Pectins
- Pectins are a heterogenous, branched and highly
hydrated group of polysaccharides rich in D-galacturonic
acid.
- Pectins are often described as ‘block’ polymers since
they consist of ‘smooth’ blocks of contigous unbranched
α-D- galacturonic acid residues punctuated by the
occasional rhamnose, with intervening homoGal blocks
sometimes not.
Pectins also contain so-called ‘hairy’ blocks that contain
numerous other sugars (See figure 10).
Figure 10: Simplified structure of Pectin
(Brett and Waldron, 1996)
Proposed functions
- Dicot pectins are known to form rigid insoluble
gels in the presence of Ca 2+ . Pectins are thought to
function to cement adjacent cells together (abundant in
middle lamella) since the use of pectinolytic enzymes
and chelating agents causes rapid release of single cells
from many soft plant tissues.
STRUCTURAL PROTEIN COMPONENTS
OF THE PRIMARY CELL WALL
N.B. In the literature you can find a variety of terminology
used for the various ‘classes’ of cell wall proteins, which
are all much of a muchness so don’t worry!
Glycine-rich proteins (GRPs)
(1) Rich in glycine can contain up to 70%.
(2) Repeat motif of Gly-X where X is most often Glycine!
(3) Two broad classes of GRPs:
(a) Cell wall-associated and developmentally regulated
(young leaves and stems, after wounding, young xylem
secondary cell walls).
(b) Cytoplasmically regulated by a variety of stress
conditions.
Putative function:
- There is strong evidence that GRPs act as the
scaffold for the deposition of lignin in the xylem.
Extensins
- First cell wall associated protein to be discovered
(1960) Dr. D. Lamport.
- Abundant in dicot primary cell walls and are
charcterised by the following features:
(1) Rich in hydoxyproline and serine and some
combination of valine, tryrosine, lysine and histidine.
(2) They usually contain multiple repeats of the a.a.
Motif Ser (Hyp)4.
(3) Most of the hydroxyproline residues are glycosylated
with one to four arabinose residues, and some serines
are glycosylated with a single galactose unit.
(4) Basic proteins pI = 10 with a rod-like appearance when
viewed on TEM (polyproline II helix).
(5) Encoded by multigene family.
(6) Accumulates in tissues in response to:
Wounding, pathogens, ethylene, oligosaccharides elicitors.
Proposed function:
(a) Contribution to the control of cell wall expansion - high
levels of extensin cause decrease in cell growth, similar
role to collagen in animal tissues (rigidify wall).
(b) Resistance to pathogenic attack - Stimuli increase its
levels. Charge on extensin may interact with surface of
pathogens and cause them to agglutinate.

(1) Rich in proline.

(3) The second proline in this sequence is often modified
to hydroxyproline.
(4) Fall into two broad classes ie. those that are
components of ‘normal’ cell walls and those that are plant
nodulins and constitute part of the nodule cell wall.
(5) Encoded by a multigene family and expressed in a cell
specific manner.
Putative functions:
- Pollen guidence
- Early nodulins (ENODS)
Solanaceous lectins
- Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins of
diverse origin. The Solanaceous lectins represent
a unique class of plant lectins which:
(1) Are restricted to occurrence in Solanaceous
species. (Tomato, potato, tobacco and P ?)
(2) Their ability to agglutinate oligomers of N-
acetylglucosamine.
(3) Their predominantly extracellular location, and their
unusual amino acid and carbohydrate composition in
which hydroxyproline and arabinose are major
constituents.
Function: Thought to be involved in cell-cell
communication.
Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs)
- The AGPs constitute a multigene family of highly
gylcosylated proteins most of which are members of the
superfamily of plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins.
- AGPs were originally defined as having the following
characteristics:
(a) Diagnostically precipitated by β-glucosyl Yariv reagent.
(b) Possession of an acidic isoelectric point.
(C) Containing 2-10% protein by weight.
(d) Carbohydrate moiety of arabinose and galactose in
the form of a type II arabino-3, 6 galactan with terminal
residues often consisting of α- arabinofuranoside and
minor amounts of uronic acids.
(e) Core proteins most often rich in hydroxyproline,
alanine, serine, threonine and glycine.
- Associated with cell wall, plasma membrane and
intercellular spaces in both lower and higher plants.
Role(s):
- Despite no definitive role as yet being assigned
to AGPs, in recent years they have been shown to be
associated with a number of developmental processes
which suggest their involvement in cell-cell recognition
and communication events.

- From this brief introduction to the plant extracellular
matrix/cell wall I hope that you no longer view it as a
boring, rigid, box surrounding the cell; but rather
as a dynamic structure which plays a crucial role in
plant growth and development.
SUMMARY

The Animal Extracellular Matrix
ECM: Definition and Function
The acellular material surrounding animal cells is termed the animal
extracellular matrix (ECM) Function:
- Mechanical support for cells and
tissues.
- Integrates cells in to tissues.
- Influences cell shape and cell
movement.
- Influences cell development and
differentiation.
- Coordinates cellular functions through
signaling with cellular adhesion
receptors.
-Reservoir for extracellular signaling
molecules
Structure of ECM:
- Fibers: collagen and elastin, which provide strength and flexibility.
- Proteoglycans: protein – saccharide complexes.
- Adhesive glycoproteins: ‘glue’ cells and ECM, e.g. fibronectin and laminin.
Connective Tissues
A histological classification:
- Loose connective tissue: supports epithelia and
organs.
- Dense connective tissue:
Irregular: forms protective capsules around organs.
Regular: mechanical resistance, connection of tissues
(ligaments and tendons).
- Adipose tissue: insulates, protects, energy store
(subcutis, renal pelvis, kidneys, mammary glands).
- Reticular tissue: framework of lymphatic tissues
(spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver).
- Blood: transport, immune defence.
-Cartilage: provides support and flexibility (rib cage,
trachea, bronchi, joints).
- Bone: body support.
Specialised cells reside in the ECM
-blasts: create the ECM
-cytes: maintain the ECM
-clasts: ECM breakdown and remodeling.
Fibrous ECM Proteins: Collagen
- Collagens make up ~25% of total protein mass
in mammals.
- Collagen comprises 25 isoforms.
- Collagen type I, II and III are organised in fibers.
- Each fiber consists of fibrils.
- Fibrils contain collagen molecules, made of
three coiled polypeptide α- chains.
-Collagens are rich in proline (stabilises helical
structures) and glycine (allows the dense packing
of three α - chains).
- Exists in large quantity in ECM of skin, bone,
tendon, cartilage and other connective for support and
protection.
- Collagen fibers withstand high pulling forces.
- It takes 10kg to rupture a fiber.
Collagen Synthesis and Assembly
ER/Golgi: Pro-a-chains are produced,
hydroxylated and glycosylated at selected
Lys and Pro residues.
- A lack of vitamin C prevents hydroxylation
-> impaired fibril formation (scurvy).
- Processed pro-peptides assemble in to
triple – helical pro-collagen.
- Golgi: Disulphide bonds form btwn the N-
and C- termini of procollagen.
-After exocytosis, N- and C-termini are
trimmed, allowing fibril assembly.
Fibrous ECM Proteins: Elastin
- Elastic fibers permit long-range deformability and passive recoil.
- This function is crucial for arteries, lung, skin and other dynamic connective
tissues that undergo cycles of extension and recoil.
- The major component of elastic fibers is the thread-like protein elastin.
- Fibrillins provide an outer structure for amorphous, cross-linked elastin.
- During ageing, elastin is degraded and becomes inflexible.
Adhesive Glycoproteins: Fibronectin (FN)
- Adhesive glycoproteins such as fibronectin and laminin
mediate the connections btwn the ECM and the cell
membrane.
- Adhesive proteins bind to proteoglycans, collagens and
to transmembrane ECM-receptors (integrins).
- Fibronectin is a dimer of two identical 250 kDa subunits.
- Alternative splicing of one gene produces ~20 human FNs.
- FN exists as a soluble form (plasma FN) and cellular FN.
- Plasma FN is predominantly produced in the liver.
- Cellular FN is deposited in to the ECM by a cell-mediated
process, called FN fibrillogenesis.
- FN binds to a variety of other proteins such as integrins,
heparin, collagen & fibrin. It also binds to itself.
Adhesive Glycoproteins: Laminin (LN)
- LNs are cross-shaped proteins.
- All LN isoforms contain α, ß1 & ß2 chains that
are connected by disulphide bonds.
- LN binds to membrane receptors (integrins) of
the overlying cells.
- LN attaches cells to the basal lamina.
- LN contains binding sites for other components
of the basal lamina: type IV collagen, heparin,
heparin sulphate and entactin.
The Basement Membrane (BM)
The BM (basal lamina) separates epithelial cells and underlying connective tissue.
BM: Collagen IV
- Collagen IV is most abundant protein in the BM.
- Collagen IV is usually found in BM’s but also associates with
fibrotic reactions and occurs in the stroma surrounding tumors.
-Like other collagens it forms self-assembled networks.
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
GAGs are hydrophilic polymers of disaccharides that form a gelatinous
matrix.
- GAGs are highly negatively charged.
- Very rigid due to charge repulsion ->
obtain a large volume.
- Attract osmotically active cations; thus
they bind water and swell.
-This results in turgor pressure and allows
connective tissue to resist compression.
-GAGs differ in the type of sugars in the
disaccharide in their chemical bond.
The most common GAGs are:
Hyaluronan (HA) - glucuronate + N-acetyl-glucosamine
Chondrotin sulphate - glucuronate + N-acetyl-galactosamine
Heparan sulphate - glucuronate + N-sulfo-glucosamine
Keratan sulphate - galactose + N-acetyl-glucosamine
Hyaluronan (HA)
HA - is a large unbranched and negatively charged
polymer of repeating (2-25K) disaccharides.
- Like other GAGs it may be part of proteoglycans.
- Unlike other GAGs it is synthesised freely at the plasma membrane
by hyaluronan synthases.
- Free HA is found in the ECM of migrating cells.
- HA binds to cell surface receptors (CD44, RHAMM).
- HA binds proteoglycans.
fibrosarcoma cells + hyaluronase
Proteoglycans
- Proteoglycans consist of a core protein to which GAGs are covalently
attached.
-The protein-GAG linkage is always made btwn Ser and the 3-sugar
‘linker’ Xyl-Gal-Gal, followed by Glucoronic acid.
-Proteoglycans are found both in ECM and attached to the plasma
membrane.
ECM Proteoglycans: Aggrecan
- In cartilage the key proteoglycan is aggrecan (200,000,000 D).
- The central component of aggrecan is hyaluronan.
- At 40nm intervals aggrecan core proteins are attached (assisted by a linker
protein) to a decasaccharide sequence in hyaluronan.
- Attached to the aggrecan core protein are multiple GAGs.
- The major GAGs in aggrecan are condroitin sulphate and keratin sulphate.
Cell Surface Proteoglycans: Syndecan
- Membrane-associated proteoglycans are mostly heparan-sulphate
substituted and are either transmembrane like syndecan or GPI- membrane
anchored (like AGPs in plant cell wall/ECM).
- The core protein spans the membrane with a short cytosolic domain.
- The GAGs (heparan sulphate chains) are attached via the trisaccharide linker
to Ser residues.
-Syndecan binds extracellulary to collagens and fibronectin and intracellularly
to the cytoskeleton.
Concluding statements on plant, animal and microbial
ECMs
Today you have been introduced to the molecular
composition, structure and biological function(s) of the bacterial, plant and
animal ECM/cell wall.
As is clear, there are many similarities and differences btwn these three
structures. When you revise please read these three sets of notes
together.

THE PLANT GOLGI APPARATUS
2
Introduction
- The Golgi apparatus is the enigmatic organelle
responsible for modifying newly synthesised proteins
and lipids. Furthermore, in plant cells the Golgi is also
the site for synthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides
destined for the plant cell wall.
- Discovered by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi
in 1898, the apparatus consists of a stack of disc-shaped
membranes called cisternae.
3
Cell wall biosynthesis
- Cellulose is synthesised at the plasma membrane
by rosettes of cellulose synthase.
- The plant Golgi apparatus plays an important
role in protein glycosylation and sorting, it also functions
as a major biosynthetic organelle that produces large
quantities of cell wall - associated non cellulosic
polysaccharides and structural glycoproteins.
4
- This is reflected in the organisation of the Golgi
apparatus as numerous individual stacks of
cisternae that are dispersed throughout the
cytoplasm.
- Each stack is polarised : the shape of the
cisternae change in a cis to trans direction, and the
cisternae on the trans side contain more
polysaccharides.
5
- The protein backbone of cell surface - associated
glycoproteins is made in the ER and subsequently
transferred to the Golgi apparatus for the addition of glycan
moieties (See figures 1 & 2).
- Therefore, the plant Golgi apparatus is an organelle
specialised for sugar transfer to polysaccharides,
glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Biosynthetic functions of the plant Golgi apparatus.
- The plant Golgi apparatus synthesises a wide range
of cell wall polysaccharides and proteoglycans, and also
carries out O-linked glycosylation and N-linked glycan
processing.
- The glycosyltransferases responsible
for the synthesis of these glycans recognise specific
donor and acceptor substrates and are located in the
Golgi lumen.
9
- Since the millennium, genes encoding several
glycosyltransferases involved in hemicellulose or
glycoprotein synthesis have been cloned.
(Keegstra & Raikel, 2001; Goubet et al, 2003; Loutre et al, 2003 etc etc).
- Glycosyltransferases use sugars that are activated
by the addition of a nucleotide (nucleotide sugars) for
donation of the sugar moiety.
10
- Current evidence suggests that the enzymes for
NS synthesis are located in the cytosol.
- This presents a problem of topology,
because both the Golgi glycosylation reactions
and their products are luminal (Figure 3).
11
- Therefore, it has been proposed that nucleotide
sugar transporters (NSTs) provide the NS substrates for
the luminally orientated glycosyltransferases, and such
activities have been detected in plant Golgi membranes
(Munoz et al, 1996; Neckelmann and Orellana, 1998; Wulff et al, 2000 etc etc).
- The first plant NST was cloned and characterised in
Arabidopsis thaliana (Baldwin et al, 2001). Since which
time, a wide variety of NSTs have been cloned and
characterised in Arabidopsis and other species
(Norambuena et al, 2002; Handford et al, 2004, 2012; Baker et al, 2005;
Norambuena et al, 2005; Reyes et al, 2006; & Mortimer et al, 2013 etc etc) .

Models for transport of proteins etc. through the Golgi to
the cell surface
- It is known that newly made proteins, lipids etc are
made in the ER and delivered to the cis face of the Golgi.
They exit, fully processed, at the opposite end – the
trans face.
- But how do they traverse the Golgi stack? This
question that has puzzled cell biologists since the 1960s!
- Two papers in Nature published in Nature in 2006
resolved the matter in favour of the so-called
‘cisternal maturation model’.
19
- This model proposes that the cisternae progress
through the Golgi, gradually moving through the stack
as new layers form at the cis face and old layers disperse
from the trans face, and that they carry the secretory
proteins with them (Nature: figure 1a).
- By contrast, the ‘vesicle-shuttle model’ (Nature:
figure 1b) proposes that Golgi cisternae are long-lived
structures, with secretory proteins being transported
from layer to layer in vesicles, which bud off one cisternae
and fuse with the next to release their cargo.
20
Nature (2006), vol 441, p 939.Nature (2006), vol 441, p 939.
21
- At the heart of this controversy are the transport
vesicles. These vesicles are called COPI vesicles-
after the coat-protein complex I (COPI) proteins that
encrust their surface.
- There is broad consensus that COPI vesicles bud
from Golgi cisternae, but no clear evidence about what
these vesicles carry, or in which direction they travel
-cis to trans, or the reverse.
22
- Many issues related to the function of these
vesicles remained unresolved. However, Losev et
al, 2006 and Matsuura et al, 2006 have
independently provided very convincing evidence
that gives direct evidence for the cisternal
maturation model.
- These authors exploited the fact that in
brewer’s yeast the Golgi cisternae are not stacked.
This organisation makes it possible to follow
cisternal dynamics by video microscopy of live
cells.
23
- Resident proteins characteristic of early and late
Golgi cisternae were tagged with fluorescent tags
to mark the different cisternae. Remarkably, the tagged
cisternae changed colour over time, showing a
progression.
- For instance, a green early Golgi cisterna
became yellow and then red, as it lost the early marker
and acquired the late Golgi marker.
(N.B. in these labelling expts green and red together
produces a yellow colouration).
24
These finding are consistent with a cisternal
maturation model for Golgi trafficking in budding yeast.
However, the story is not yet complete a few key
predictions of the cisternal maturation model remain to be
tested.
There is still an ongoing debate in this area nearly
twenty years since these breakthrough papers were
published.
This is still a very active area of research
and discussion.

- The stacks of the Golgi are usually dispersed
throughout the plant cell cytoplasm singly or in small
groups.
- In cells with localised sites of cell wall growth or
intensive secretion, Golgi stacks can become
concentrated to specific subcellular regions. Within tip
growing cells, like root hairs and pollen tubes, Golgi
bodies are localised in a region a small distance away
from the growing tip (see figure 5)
27
- Plant cells divide by the de novo formation of a
separating cell wall between daughter cells.
Formation of the cell plate requires intensive
secretion of Golgi - synthesised cell wall
polysaccharides.
The phragmoplast, a structure containing
microfilaments and microtubules, spatially orients
and positions the new cell wall by directing Golgi-
derived vesicles to the cell plate (Figure 6).

- Perhaps with the discovery of Golgi proteins that
can be fused to GFP, the timing and mechanism of Golgi
replication may be investigated more thoroughly within
living plant tissues.
Morphology and polarisation of individual Golgi stacks.
- The size and morphology of individual plant Golgi
stacks vary tremendously between different cell types and
species. The cisternal membranes and associated vesicles
can be from 0.5m to 2.0μm in diameter. Golgi stacks are
usually composed of three to eight cisternae ( Fig 1 ), and
may be composed of 15 or more in scale-secreting algal
cells. Nevertheless, within a single cell, the cisternal
number is remarkably uniform.
31
- In cells secreting large amounts of material, the
stack polarity is exaggerated. For example, in
slime-secreting maize root cap cells the trans-most
cisternal rims are dilated or connected to huge vesicles
which bud from the trans side of the Golgi stack. Similar
differentiation of Golgi stack morphology is also seen in
slime secreting cells of root tip cells of tobacco and
Arabidopsis. These cells show beautifully how the Golgi
morphology of different plant cells reflects their functional
differences.
Biosynthetic functions of the plant Golgi apparatus.
- As mentioned earlier the plant Golgi apparatus
synthesises a wide range of cell wall polysaccharides
and proteoglycans, and also carries out O-linked
glycosylation and N-linked glycan processing.

- Recent studies have also shown that glycolipids
are modified in the plant Golgi as they are in animal and
yeast Golgi!
- In recent years, the realisation of the crucial role
of the plant cell surface in growth and development
has triggered a renaissance in cell wall research.
33
- Much of the renewed interest in this field stems
from the potential to alter cell wall composition,
which would be of major importance in the food and
timber industries and for the production of biofuels.
- As mentioned earlier cellulose synthesis
occurs on the plasma membrane, whereas non-
cellulosic polysaccharides are synthesised in the
Golgi.
34
- The protein backbone of cell surface - associated
glycoproteins is made in the ER and subsequentely
transferred to the Golgi apparatus for the addition of glycan
moieties (See figure 1 & 7).
- Therefore, the plant Golgi apparatus is an organelle
specialised for sugar transfer to polysaccharides and
glycoproteins and lipids.
- Noncellulosic polysaccharides and cell surface-
associated glycoproteins contain a number of different
sugars, such as galactose, arabinose, fucose, xylose,
mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galacturonic acid and
glucuronic acid.

Osmoregulation in plants
Introduction
- Life on earth presents a challenge to land plants.
On the one hand, the atmosphere is the source of CO2
which is required for phs. On the other hand, the atms
is relatively dry and can dehydrate the plant.
In this lecture we will examine some of the mechanisms
and driving forces operating on water transport within the
plant and between the plant and its envt.
Transpirational water loss from the leaf is driven by a
gradient in water vapor concn. Long-dist transport in the
xylem is driven by pressure gradients, as is water movt
in the soil. Water transport through cell layers such as
the root cortex is complex.
Water in the soil
- The water content and rate of water movement in
soils depend to a large extent on soil type and soil
structure. Figure 1 shows the physical characteristics of
different soils. At one extreme is sand, in which the soil
particles may be 1mm or more in diameter. Sandy soils
have a relatively low surface area per gram of soil and
have large air spaces.
- At the other extreme is clay, in which particles
are smaller than 2μm in diameter. Clay soils have much
greater surface areas and smaller channels btwn prtcls.
With the aid of organic matter , clay prtcls may aggregate
into ‘crumbs’ that help improve soil aeration and
infiltration of water.
Figure 1 (Source: Taiz and Zeigler, 2002)Figure 1 (Source: Taiz and Zeigler, 2002)
• Classification (NOTE: 1,000 m = 1 mm)
• Fine particles
– Clay (less than 2 m);
– Silt (2 m - 64 m)
• Sand grade particles
– Fine sand (64 m – 125 m)
– Medium sand (125 m – 500 m)
– Coarse sand (500 m – 2,000 m)
• Granules (2 – 4 mm)
• Pebbles (4 – 64 mm)
• Then cobbles and boulders
Particle size
- When a soil is heavily watered the water percolates
downward by gravity through the spaces btwn the soil
parctls, partly displacing, and in some cases trapping,
air in these channels. Water in the soil may exist as a film
adhering to the surface of soil particles or it may fill the
spaces btwn partcls.
- The moisture-holding capacity of soils is called the
field capacity. Field capacity is the water content of a
soil after it has been saturated with water and excess
water has been allowed to drain away.
- Clay soils or soils with a high humus content have a
large field capacity. A few days after being saturated, they
might retain 40% water by volume. In contrast sandy soils
typically retain 3% water by volume after saturation.
Water absorption by roots
- Intimate contact btwn the surface of the root and the
soil is essential for effective water absorption by the root.
This contact provides the surface area required for water
uptake and is maximised by the growth of the root and of
root hairs into the soil. Root hairs increase the SA
of the root enormously e.g. in 4-month old rye (Secale)
the root hairs constitute more than 60% of the SA of
the roots.
- Water enters the root most readily in the apical part
of the root that includes the root hair zone. More mature
regions of the root often have an outer layer of protective
tissue, called an exodermis, that contains hydrophobic
materials in its walls and is relatively impermeable to water.
Water moves in the root via the apoplast, transmembrane
and symplast pathways.
- In the soil, water is transported predominantly by bulk
flow. However, when water comes into contact with the root
surface, the nature of water transport becomes more
complex. From the epidermis to the endodermis of the root,
there are three pathways through which water can flow
(see figure 2): the apoplast, transmembrane and symplast
pathways.
1. In the apoplast pathway, water moves exclusively through
the cell wall without crossing any membranes. The apoplast
is the continuous system of cell walls and intercellular
air spaces in plant tissues.
Figure 2 (Source: Taiz and Zeigler, 2002)Figure 2 (Source: Taiz and Zeigler, 2002)
2. The transmembrane pathway is the route followed
by water that sequentially enters a cell on one side, exits
the cell on the other side, enters the next in the series,
and so on. In this pathway, water crosses at least two
membranes for each cell in its path (the pm on entering
and leaving). Transport across the tonoplast may also
be involved.
3. In the symplast pathway, water travels from one cell to
the next via plasmodesmata. The symplast consists of the
entire network of cell cytoplasm interconnected by pd.
- Although the relative importance of these three
pathways has not been established, this in an ongoing
area of research.
- At the endodermis, water movement through the
apoplast pathway is obstructed by the Casparian strip.
The Casparian strip is a band of radial cell walls in the
endodermis that is impregnated with the waxlike,
hydrophobic substance, suberin. Suberin acts as a barrier
to water and solute movement.
- The endodermis becomes suberised in the
nongrowing part of the root, several millimetres behind the
root tip, at about the same time that the first protoxylem
elements mature (Esau, 1953). The Casparian strip breaks
the continuity of the apoplast pathway, and forces water
and solutes to cross the endodermis by passing through
the plasma membrane. Thus, despite the importance of
the apoplast pathway in the root cortex and the stele, water
movement across the endodermis occurs through the
symplast.
Solute accumulation in the xylem can generate
“root pressure”.
- Plants sometimes exhibit a phenomenon of root
pressure. For example, if the stem of a young seedling is
cut off just above the soil, the stump will often exude sap
from the cut xylem for many hours.
- Roots generate positive hydrostatic pressure by
absorbing ions from the dilute soil solution and transporting
them into the xylem. The buildup of solutes in the xylem sap
leads to a decrease in the xylem osmotic potential (Ψs ) and
thus a decrease in the xylem water potential (Ψw ) . This
lowering of the xylem Ψw provides a driving force for water
absorption, which in turn leads to a positive hydrostatic
pressure in the xylem.
- In effect, the whole root acts like an osmotic cell;
the multicellular root tissue behaves as an osmotic
membrane does, building up a positive hydrostatic
pressure in the xylem in response to the accumulation
of solutes.
- Root pressure is most likely to occur when soil
water potentials are high and transpiration rates are low.
When transpiration rates are high, water is taken up so
rapidly into leaves and lost to the atmosphere that a
positive pressure never develops in the xylem.
- Plants that develop root pressure frequently
produce liquid droplets on the edge of their leaves, a
phenomenon known as GUTTATION (see figure 3).
- Positive xylem pressure causes exudation of
xylem sap through specialised pores called hydathodes
that are associated with vein endings at the leaf margin.
- The “dewdrops” that can be seen on tips of grass
leaves in the morning are actually guttation droplets
exuded from such specialised pores. Guttation is most
noticeable when transpiration is suppressed and the
relative humidity is high, such as during the night.
Xylem transport (self study)
Figure 3Figure 3
(Source:(Source:
Taiz and Zeigler,Taiz and Zeigler,
2002)2002)
Water evaporation in the leaf generates a negative
pressure in the xylem.
- The tensions needed to pull water through the xylem
are the result of evaporation of water from leaves. In the
intact plant, water is brought to the leaves via the xylem
of the leaf vascular bundle, which branches into a very fine
and sometimes intricate network of veins throughout the
leaf (figure 4).
- This venation pattern becomes so finely branched
that most cells in a typical leaf are within 0.5mm of a minor
vein. From the xylem, water is drawn into the cells of the
leaf and along the cell walls.
Figure 4 (Source:Figure 4 (Source:
Taiz and Zeigler,Taiz and Zeigler,
2002)2002)
- The negative pressure that causes water to move
up through the xylem develops at the surface of the cell
walls in the leaf. The situation is analogous to that in the
soil. The cell wall acts like a very fine capillary wick soaked
with water.
- Water adheres to the cellulose microfibrils and
other hydrophilic components of the wall. The mesophyll
cells within the leaf are in direct contact with the
atmosphere through an extensive system of intercellular
air spaces.
- Initially water evaporates from a thin film lining these
air spaces. As water is lost to the air, the surface of the
remaining water is drawn into the interstices of the cell
wall (fig 5), where it forms curved air-water interfaces.
Because of the high surface tension of water, the curvature
of these interfaces induces a tension, or negative pressure,
in the water.
- As more water is removed from the wall, the radius of
curvature of the air-water interfaces decreases and the
pressure of the water becomes more negative. Thus more
motive force is generated at the air-water interface.

WATER MOVEMENT FROM THE LEAF TO THE
ATMOSPHERE
- After water has evaporated from the cell surface
into the intercellular air space, diffusion is the primary
means of any further movement of the water out of the
leaf. The waxy cuticle that covers the leaf is a very
effective barrier to water movement. It has been estimated
that only about 5% of the water lost from leaves escapes
through the cuticle. Almost all of the water lost from
typical leaves is lost by diffusion of water vapour through
the stomata.
- On its way from the leaf to the atmosphere, water
is pulled from the xylem into the cell walls of the
mesophyll, where it evaporates into the air spaces of the
leaf. The water vapour then exits the leaf through the
stomata. Water moves along this pathway predominately
by diffusion, so this water movement is controlled by
the concentration gradient of water vapour (figure 6).
Read up on water vapour diffusion and the main resistances
in the diffusion pathway from the leaf to the atmosphere.

Angiosperm reproductive
biology.
Introduction:
This lecture describes why angiosperms have become
the predominant flora on Earth.
- Seed plants such as Gymnosperms and
Angiosperms have acquired seemingly two major
advantages compared to Pteridophytes:
1) Removal of the dependence of the sexual process
on external water.
2) Protection and dispersal of the resultant zygote in
a seed.
- However, only 700 species of Gymnosperms exist
compared to 10, 000 Pteridophytes and ~300, 000 species
of Angiosperms!
- As mentioned earlier Angiosperms comprise the
dominant form of plant life on earth. They have managed to
inhabit a much wider range of ecological niches than either
the Pteridophytes or the Gymnosperms, and this accounts
for their dominance.
- They have also been able to adopt a much wider
range of means of achieving sexual reproduction in terms
of spore travel (pollination), control of mating partner both
before and after pollination and fertilisation, and seed
protection and dispersal than have either the Pteridophytes
or the Gymnosperms.
- This variety of mating systems so characteristic
of flowering plants has been the cause of the structural
diversity of this group and is the key to their success.
This structural variety has been achieved in two ways.
(A) By maximising the opportunities for the reproductive
isolation of demes (a local interbreeding unit within which
there is unrestricted breeding) , and thus encouraging their
speciation.
(B) By utilising features of their environment (most often
animals) to transport pollen and seeds to specific sites
which has greatly increased the potential number of species
-specific niches that they could exploit within any particular
environment.
- Both these features and hence the success of the
Angiosperms have arisen as a result of the development
of the gynoecium (which is considered by many plant
scientists to be the single most significant advance in the
evolution of land plants).
The gynoecium
- Just as the seed plants enclosed the process of
sexual fusion and protected the zygote by allowing male
and female gametophytes to remain within the
megasporangium (ovule = seed) so the Angiosperms have
further enclosed the ovule within a modified sporangium-
bearing leaf (megasporophyll) which is termed the carpel.
- The gynoecium consists of the megasporophylls
of a flower and their contents; the carpels whether free
or fused into an ovary, and their ovules, styles and stigmas
(Figure 1). The enclosure of the ovules in the carpel has
had a number of consequences.
(I) Following the enclosure of the micropylar area of the
ovule it has been necessary for a pollen reception area
to evolve outside the carpel which is termed the stigma.
(II) The freeing of some of the foliar organs of the floral axis
functions from protection of the ovule allowed them to
assume other functions such as attraction of pollinators
(tepals, petals), reward for pollinators (nectaries), or
protection of floral axis (tepals, sepals).
(III) The continued enclosure of the ovule (seed) after
fertilisation allowed great diversification to develop in the
process of protection, transportation and release of the
seed itself. In the Angiosperms, ovaries (fruits) have
developed colours, odours and food to encourage
ingestion by animals; hooks, glue and external secretions
to encourage external transportation by animals; wings
and hairs for transport; and many other devices.
- Thus, the gynoecium has spectacularly influenced
angiosperm reproduction and breeding systems at all
stages from pollination to seed germination, allowing the
development of great diversity and ecological niches.
Angiosperm reproduction
- Now we shall review the basics of angiosperm
reproduction (please also refer to 4AB026 lecture notes).
Stamens, pollen and the male gametophyte
- Most angiosperm stamens are composed of a
narrow stalk (filament), and an anther which is a
microsporangium. The anther is usually composed of two
segments, logitudinally joined by the connective which
each contain two pollen sacs (locules) although these may
be fused within each segment (figure 1).
- Within each locule an archesporial cell divides
mitotically to yield many pollen grain mother cells
(PMC) which undergo meiosis to give haploid tetrads
of microspores. These separate and develop as pollen
grains within the anther.
- They are surrounded by a single layer of endothecial
cells, the tapetum, which act as secretory nurse cells. The
mature anther most often dehisces longitudinally, towards
the inside (introrse) or the outside (extrorse) of the flower.
Figure 1Figure 1
- The pollen grain, is a haploid microspore not
dissimilar in structure to Gymnosperm pollen, but is
readily identified by the structure of the outer wall (exine),
between the continous inner layer (nexine) and the
perforated outer layer (tectum).
- The exine is constructed primarily of a lipoprotein
(sporopollenin), whereas the inner wall (intine) is made of
cellulose. The intine may be variously decorated with
spines, furrows etc; and usually has one to four pores,
which may or may not be associated with furrows (Figure
2).
Figure 2Figure 2
- Within the grain, one or two mitoses have taken
place to yield two or three haploid nuclei. The timing of the
first pollen grain mitosis varies widely, occuring rapidly in
those species with fast pollen development such as those
indigenous to tropical countries.
- The mitosis in the pollen grain is ‘abnormal’, being
asymmetrical. After the first division, two unequally sized
cells, without a cellulose partition arise. The larger central
cell (vegetative cell) and the smaller peripheral cell
(generative cell) together form the highly reduced
gametophyte.
- The generative cell can divide into the male gametes
at an early stage or this second mitosis may occur after
pollen germination (Maheshwari, 1949). Thus some pollen
grains are binucleate with a vegetative and a generative
nucleus whereas others are trinucleate with a vegetative
nucleus and two male gametes (sperm cells). There is very
strong correlation between the nature of the stigmatic
papillae (wet or dry), and the control of genetic Self
incompatibility.
Wet stigma -------> gametophytically controlled
Dry stigma -> sporophytically controlled
Pollen germination
- When mature pollen is released from the anther it
normally has a very short life. In some grass species this
may be as short as 30 minutes, and even in insect-
pollinated species with sticky pollen it rarely exceeds one
day, although much longer periods of natural viability
have been recorded in some fruit tree species (Maheshwari
and Rangaswamy, 1965).
- The only essential requirements for the germination
of many types of pollen grain seem to be water and oxygen.
Rather unexpectedely, boron is necessary for the
successful germination of pollen in many species. Boron is
deficient in pollen but occurs at comparatively high concs
in stigmatic and stylar tissues.
- Calcium gradients are also important chemotropic
agents for pollen tubes growing within the gynoecia in
many flowering plants.
- The stigma is usually receptive to pollen over a
relatively short time frame. Legitimate pollen alighting upon
a ‘ripe’ stigma will adhere to it.
- There are two main types of stigma recognised in
flowering plants termed ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ respectively.
Which can be differentiated as follows:
- Wet stigmas produce a stigmatic exudate containing
free sugars, lipids, phenolic compounds and traces of
enzymes.
- This exudate appears to perform four distinct
functions:
(A) Attaching the pollen to the stigma surface.
(B) Hydrating the pollen.
(C) Providing a suitable medium for the initial growth of
the pollen tube.
(D) Preventing the stigmatic papillae from drying out
(gappy cuticle).
- In contrast, in species which possess a dry stigma,
which is typical of most plants which exhibit a
sporophytically controlled SI system there is no stigmatic
exudate.
- In these species the pollen grains adhere to the
stigmatic surface by virtue of their external cover of
lipoprotein ‘pollenkitt/tryphine’ which is secreted onto the
developing grains as the tapetum degrades. The grain
then ‘communicates’ with the stigma and absorbs water
(hydrates) the grain then proceeds to germinate, the pollen
tube appears and grows onto the stigmatic surface.
Pollen tube growth
- Upon germination following hydration of the pollen
grain the pollen tube emerges from the germinal aperture.
- The pollen tube is comprised of a callosic wall layer
and a pectinaceous wall layer, three cells and a large
number of organelles.
- In species with ‘wet’ stigmas such as Antirrhinum
and Nicotiana the pollen tubes grow through the
intercellular matrix of the stigmatic tissue and enter the
style. Once successful penetration of the style has been
achieved, the pollen tube grows down the papilla and
enters the style proper.
- Once within the style, pollen tubes adopt a
heterotrophic mode of growth utilising nutrients from
the pistil.
- Evidence from several systems indicates that normal
tube growth of bicellular pollen is biphasic, with a slow
initial period of growth, probably on pollen reserves,
followed by a more rapid elongation, involving
heterotrophic nutrition by the style.
- Besides its probable role in the nutrition of
compatible pollen tubes, the style is also involved in
controlling pollen tube growth, not only by provision of a
physical conduit but also by the production of molecular
components that interact with the growing tip of the tube.
- The final destination of the pollen tubes, the ovules,
is generally enveloped by one or two integumentary layers
(see figure X), which have grown up around the nucellus
and embryo sac leaving only a small hole, the micropyle,
through which the pollen tube will enter.
- When pollen tubes arrive at the ovary they generally
grow directly to the ovules. The remarkable precision of
pollen tube growth within the ovary in compatible matings
suggests that tube routes are not random!
- Entry to the ovules (See figure 3) is often facilitated
by anatomical modifications of the ovary, such as an
obturator, to bring the mouth of the micropyle close to the
surface along which the tubes are growing.
Double fusion
- In the embryo sac (female gametophyte), four
unwalled cells lie at the polar (micropylar) end (figure 3)
of the two synergids, the larger lies against the exterior
of the embryo-sac with the egg cell in close conjunction.
- The other synergid is close by, and the dikaryotic
primary endosperm nucleus is distal to the egg cell. The
proximal (larger) synergid has produced outgrowths
(filiform apparatus), and after pollination, but before the
arrival of the pollen tube at the embryo-sac, they start to
degenerate. The vacuole of the synergid has high levels
of calcium which are released on degeneration and
probably act as a close-range chemotropic attractant to
the pollen tubes.
Figure 3Figure 3
- The tube penetrates the synergid and ruptures,
releasing the two sperm cells into the degenerating
synergid. The remains of the synergid envelop the egg
cell and the primary endosperm nucleus carrying the two
sperm cells to lie in conjunction with them.
- At this point double fusion takes place, a
phenomenon that is unique to the angiosperms. One
haploid sperm cell (male gamete) fuses with the haploid
egg cell to form the diploid zygote, which will form the
embryo in the developing seed.
- The second haploid sperm cell fuses with the
primary endosperm nucleus. The result of which is a
triploid primary endosperm cell which later develops to
form the endosperm in the seed.

Excretory Processes
• Produce urine by refining a filtrate derived
from body fluids
Key functions of most excretory systems:

• Reabsorption: reclaiming valuable solutes
• Secretion: adding toxins and other solutes
from the body fluids to the filtrate
• Excretion: removing the filtrate from the
system

• Each segment of earthworm has a pair of
Metanephridia
• tubules that collect coelomic fluid & produce dilute
urine for excretion
Malpighian Tubules
Insects/other terrestrial arthropods:

& function in osmoregulation
• Insects: relatively dry waste matter, an important adaptation to
terrestrial life

Plant – Animal Interactions
Seed Dispersal
Life cycle of a plant
• Seed dispersal is at the end of
the cycle
• Plant has been pollinated
• Ovary develops into a fruit
• Many plants develop multiple
seeds for increased
reproductive success
Focus on these 2 sections
Why do seeds disperse?
• Increased chance of survival
• Less competition than if germinates next to parent plant
• Possible movement to more favourable growth environments.
Dispersers and Non-Dispersers
• Plants need to determine whether the benefits of seed dispersal
outweigh the costs – and to what extent
• Specialisation must increase dispersal success whether
morphological, physiological or behavioural
Different types of seeds
• High levels of energy
required
• Must still be connected to
parent plant in order to
develop (cut flowers don’t
produce seeds)
• Plant needs to gather energy
from food & water whilst
seeds are developing
Different types of fruit
• Fruits are packaging for seeds
• Can be soft and fleshy, dry and woody or
papery
• Berry - Seeds are embedded in the flesh
• Drupe - A fruit with juicy flesh and seeds
inside
• Pepo - Berry with a hard, thick rind
• Pome - a fruit consisting of a fleshy
enlarged receptacle and a tough central
core containing the seeds
• Hesperidium - a fruit with sectioned pulp
inside a separable rind
When to eat
• Fruits change in colour to signal that they are ripe and ready to eat
• Evolution in order to see fruit colours
• Sir David talking about fruits - Video
Syndromes
• Technical term encompassing different methods of dispersal
• Seed dispersal syndromes – often in gymnosperms (produce ‘naked’
seeds)
• Plant pollinator syndromes – often in angiosperms (previous lecture)
Meet the Chory’s
• Chory – technical term for seed dispersal
• Preceded by term that relates to method of dispersal i.e. hydrochory
• Sir David talking about seed dispersal - Video
Meet the chory’s
• Allochory – the passive dispersal of seeds by external means i.e.
dispersal via animals or wind
• Autochory – dispersing seeds by the plant’s own means i.e. explosion
(ballochory) or dropping to the ground (barochory).
Meet the chory’s
Zoochory – seed dispersal by animals
• Hooked fruits
• Sticky fruits and seeds
• Fleshy fruits
• Edible fruits
• Endozoochory – seeds eaten and pass through digestive tract
• Epizoochory/Ectozoochory – seeds or spores accidentally attached to
the animals body and become detached later
• Synzoochory – seeds or spores intentionally carried (usually in the
mouth) to be eaten later.
Endozoochory
• Animals ingest seeds and excrete them
• Some seeds are enclosed in fleshy edible fruits – ideal food source for
frugivores
• Fruit isn’t well chewed – seed ingested whole
• Pulp is digested and seeds excreted – with fertiliser!
• Seed needs protection from digestion such as a coating
Endozoochory
• Coevolved mutualistic relationship
• Plants may advertise food resource using colour
• Some studies have found increased advantage in germination
• Video – endo and ectozoochory
• Number of seeds in droppings can be quite a lot!
• In a study on seeds found in droppings of 11 parrot species in
Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile and Argentina
• Intact seeds found
• Numbers ranged usually from 1-60
• In one dropping from a Lear’s Macaw Anodoryhnchus leari –
almost 500 seeds from blue column cactus Pilosocereus
pachycladus.
Parasitism Through Endozoochory
• Video
• Seed dispersal through birds is ornithichory.
Benefits of Endozoochory
• Distance seeds are carried
• Large bodied animals travel the furthest
• Less competition with parents and sibling plants
• Better light conditions
• Avoidance of predators
• Opportunity to colonise new habitats
• Higher germination rates – digestion removes physical layers or any
chemical compounds that inhibit seed germination
Challenges of Endozoochory
• Reliance on external influences for dispersal
• Reliance on seeds survival through eating (teeth grinding) and
digestion (chemicals)
Endozoochory in Ruminants
• Spitting of seeds whilst chewing the cud
• Cud – stage of rumination process. Semi
degraded and bought back up for 2nd chewing
• 21 species of ruminants found to aid seed
dispersal
• Most plants consumed are shrubs or trees –
fleshy or dry fruits not commonly dispersed
by defecation.
Jays and Oaks
• Oaks have a poor ability to reproduce – 1st acorn production can
take up to 20 years
• Many will drop and rot or be eaten and damaged during the
process
• Any that drop and germinate will be overshadowed by parent
• Jays Garrulus glandarius are known as the ‘chattering acorn
gatherer’
• Can carry up to 6 at a time – only chooses the best available (no
parasites). Can plant over 7000 in 4 weeks
• Buries acorns separately at the base of bushes near to grassland –
hoping to jog memory in the future of where it was buried
• Those that aren’t eaten will germinate
• Jays may then eat the cotyledons – first leaves full of stored
energy below ground
• Jays pull up oak to eat cotyledons- oak can survive this attack due
to long tap root.
Ectozoochory
• Caught on fur
• Underfoot
• Video
• Burrlike seeds and fruits, or those diaspores provided with spines, hooks,
claws, bristles, barbs, grapples, and prickles, are genuine hitchhikers,
clinging to their carriers.
• A somewhat different principle is employed by the so-called trample burrs,
said to lodge themselves between the hooves of large grazing mammals.
Examples are mule grab (Proboscidea) and the African grapple plant
(Harpagophytum).
Diplochory
• Secondary seed dispersal
• Happens when a predator devours another animal that has eaten the
seeds, such as birds of prey that feed on small seed-eating lizards.
• Dung beetles
• Disperse seeds in faeces of
collected dung
• Seed deception - video
Diploendozoochory
• Where a primary disperser
(an animal that ate a seed)
along with the seeds it is
carrying is eaten by a
predator that then carries
the seed further before
depositing it.
Caliochory
• Dispersal by birds – but not
through endozoochory
• When birds create nests
• Often use plant material or mud
• Can move long distances to nest
where seeds may drop to the
ground.
Chiropterochory
• Frugivorous bats
• Eat fleshy fruits
• Usually defecates within 20 minutes in flight
• Important role in regeneration of forests – more efficient than birds and
mammals at seed dispersal
• Also known to have fern spores in faecal pellets
• Fern spore dispersal associated with anemochory – wind dispersal
• Bats are also important in pollination – passing on pollen whilst feeding on
nectar
• Video
Malachochory
• Molluscs – mainly terrestrial snails
• Slugs and snails able to eat small seeds
• Research shows some damage to seeds during digestive process is
common.
Ichthyochory
• Seed dispersal via fish
• Aquatic plants/mangrove
species/flooded forest
• Seeds can travel up to 5km from
parent plant
• Poorly studied field – not known
whether this is by ‘chance’ or
intentional feeding regimes in
some areas
• 200 known species of fruit-
eating fish.
Saurochory
• Reptiles - snakes, lizards, crocodiles and
alligators
• Mainly carnivorous diet
• Low germination found from studies
• Can also be dispersed via epizoochory
• Seeds attached to the snouts of green
iguana (Iguana iguana) found more
effective for germination than being
consumed and excreted.
Mymrecochory
• Seed dispersal by ants – mutualistic
relationship
• Some seeds covered by an elaisome which
attracts ants – rich in lipids and proteins
• Ants carry seeds into colonies and feed
elaisome to their larvae
• Rest of seed is discarded in underground
chamber
• Relationship found in up to 23,000 flowering
plant species
Seed Mimicry
• Stick and leaf insects have low
motility
• Can be difficult to expand
populations
• Some stick and leaf insect eggs
have a similar appearance to the
elaisome which attracts the ant –
capitulum
• Insects drop or flick their eggs and
wait for the ants to take them away
• Keeps eggs safe from predators
and other above-ground threats.
Can you tell the difference? Left: Stick and
leaf insect eggs [From Robertson, J. A.,

W.Stuppy, H.Morales, G.Hoyle,
E.Vaes/RBG Kew.
Synzoochory
• Seed caching animals – often birds
• Collect food over winter
• Commonly birds carrying seeds or diaspores in their beak
• The European mistle thrush, Turdus viscivorus, deposits the
viscid seeds of European mistletoe (Viscum album) on
potential host plants when, after a meal of the berries, it
whets its bill on branches or simply regurgitates the seeds
• Birds caching seeds in holes of trees – sometimes forgotten
• Caches can be stolen from by rodents – can aid in dispersal
• In Germany an average jay may transport about 4,600 acorns
per season, over distances of up to 4 km (2.5 miles)
• Is this seed dispersal or seed predation?
Anthropochory
• Inadvertent dispersal by humans
• On clothes/shoes – same as animals
Hemerochory
• Most widespread and intense variety of seed spreading – agriculture
(conscious spreading – ethelochory)
• Create optimum conditions for growth
• Transport means dispersal can be global
• Unintentional dispersal via transport - agochory
• Can cause invasive species problems
• Seed bombing/guerrilla gardening – pros and cons.
Threats to seed dispersal
• Declining populations, fragmentation, habitat loss, invasive species
• Video – habitat fragmentation.
Summary
• Seed dispersal has clear ecological benefits
• Both plants and animals benefit
• Often mutualistic relationships
• Plant engineering in many different forms
• Animal behaviour in many different forms.

Cell cycle
• 4 events must occur
before a cell can
divide
– There must be a
reproductive signal
– Replication of DNA
– The replicated DNA must be
distributed to each of the
two new cells - Partitioning
– The cell membrane
and cell wall must
grow to separate
the two new cells
in a process called
septation which
leads to cytokinesis
(division)
Cell Cycle of E. coli. An increase in cell mass
triggers replication initiation. The origin of replication
migrates to the centre of the cell and proteins that
make up the replisome assemble. In this illustration,
one round of DNA replication is completed before
the cell divides. In rapidly growing cultures, second
and third rounds of DNA replication initiate before
the original cell division is complete. Thus the
daughter cells inherit partially replicated DNA.

• Replication is
Bi-directional and

DNA replication
For details on DNA replication refer to lectures in
5BC001 as this topic was covered in detail there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWuju1S9_E
(5 min clip)
DNA replication
• Each chromosome has;
– Origin of replication (Ori C) – where
replication begins
– Terminus – where replication finishes
– Orientated to each pole of the cell in newly
formed cells
DNA replication
• Early in the growth cycle of the cell when
initiation mass reached - terminus and origin
migrate to the mid cell
• Replisome is formed at the origin
– Proteins and enzymes for DNA synthesis collect
together
• DNA replication proceeds in both
directions
– DNA thought to spool through replisome
– New origins form and move to opposite ends of cell
DNA replication
Being the

first thought
DNA replication
• In a slow growing culture (30oC) DNA
replication and division – 60 mins
• In a fast growing culture (37oC) division - 20
mins
– DNA replication always takes 40 mins??
• Over comes this by having more than one Ori C
and by starting DNA replication early
– DNA synthesis is continuous
DNA partitioning
• Mechanism of partitioning still being defined
• Studied in model organisms: B subtilis & C. crescentus
• Various active biological protein systems that drive sister
chromosomes apart
• SMCs (structural maintenance of the chromosome) proteins
• Par system
• Entropic de-mixing
• spontaneous move apart by mixed circular polymers
• “Genome in a box” approaches to study this process
• Microfluidic device with Mbp long genome then add back proteins
to study their role
• Further insight needed & may lead to first synthetic cell
DNA partitioning in C. crescentus
The ParAB/parS Partitioning System of Caulobacter crescentus. ParB
binds parS sites on the daughter chromosomes. A gradient of ParA
proteins directs the partition complex of ParB/parS to the opposite pole of
the cell in a relay mechanism.
Septation and cytokinesis
• In cytokinesis cell elongation and
septum formation must occur
Requires:
• Termination of DNA replication
• A number of regulatory and
functional proteins
– Septum formation and constriction
– New cell wall synthesis
– Final cytokinesis to give two daughter
cells
https://youtu.be/IzKoIp08Pa4?si=aSpozP3kMJEf
h70r
Septation and cytokinesis
• Septation occurs through formation of the Z
ring - divides cell by constriction
– Formed from FtsZ – tubulin homologue
– Attaches to the plasma membrane and cell
wall
– Constriction forms the septum
– Must be formed for division to occur
– Z ring formation regulated and occurs only in
the centre due to MinC,D,E proteins -
antagonistic
– Depolymerisation of Z ring = constriction of
cell

oscillates between the poles to prevent FtsZ
polymerization at the poles. Nucleoid (green)
occlusion prevents Z-ring formation until the
two nucleoids have separated. Both
mechanisms restrict Z-ring formation to the
center of the cell.
Septation and cytokinesis
Cross-sectional View of
a Dividing Bacterial Cell.
FtsZ filaments attach to
the plasma membrane
through anchoring
proteins FtsA and ZipA,
which also coordinate the
enzymes that synthesize
and remodel
peptidoglycan in the
developing septum.
ZapA and ZapB link the Z-
ring to the chromosome
replication terminus (ter)
to ensure that septum
constriction follows
replication.
Septation and cytokinesis
• Requires the break down and rebuilding of the peptidoglycan cell
wall
• Site of cell wall synthesis differs between morphological
types
– G +ve cocci – one or few growth zones along centre
– G –ve rods – Synthesis occurs at site of septation and along cell length
Areas of cell wall synthesis in cocci and rod shaped bacterial species
Peptidoglycan extension
• Occurs in 3 stages utilising 3 different enzyme systems
• Allows synthesis without any gaps (autolysis)
1. Autolysins - break the glycosidic bonds between
the peptidoglycan monomers and break peptide
cross-bridges- create small holes in cell wall
2. Transglycosidase - enzymes insert and link new
peptidoglycan monomers into the breaks in the
peptidoglycan
3. Transpeptidase - enzymes reform the peptide
cross-links between the rows and layers of
peptidoglycan.

Summary
• Number of events must occur for growth and
division in bacterial cells
– Chromosome replication and partitioning, Z ring formation
and septation and cell wall synthesis – cytokinesis
• Chromosome replication is bidirectional and semi-
conservative – enzyme systems in replisome.
• Septation requires Z ring formation – complex protein
and enzyme system
• New cell wall is produced and inserted to allow
cytokinesis – autolysins, transglycosidases,
transpeptidases.

• Growth will only occur where water
exists as a liquid
• 0oC to 100oC
• ice to steam
• Exceptions

Effect of Temperature on Growth
• Microbes cannot moderate their
internal temperature
• Temperature affects rates of:-
• Chemical reactions
• Rate increases 3 to 4 times for every 10oC rise in
temperature.
• Enzyme reactions and Growth rate
• Too low or too high temperature inhibits rates.
• Due to effect of temperature on structure of
macromolecules

Archaeal cell membrane
• Archaea have L-glycerol
• Bacteria have D-glycerol
• Ether linkage of side-chain to glycerol
• Bacteria have Ester linkage
• Side-chain consists of repeating isoprene
units (5C), Phytanyl (20C), Biphytanyl (40C)
• Bacterial consists of fatty acids (16-18C)
• Archaea have branching side chains
• Bacterial are non-branching
Effect of temperature on proteins
• Mesophilic proteins
• 50OC-60OC
• disruption of non covalent associations
resulting in breakdown into subunits
• denaturation begins
• 80OC and over
• irreversible denaturation
• breaking of disulphide bonds
• deamination of glutamine and asparagine side
chains
• hydrolysis of peptide bonds
Effect of temperature on proteins
• Thermostable proteins
• >100OC for several days, in dilute buffer.
• None of the changes seen with mesophilic
proteins occur - WHY?
• Primary structures are slightly different
• Amino acid sequences show 95% to 85%
homology with equivalent mesophilic
proteins.
• These small differences allow proteins to
fold into more thermostable forms
Thermostable Proteins
• Adaptations include:
• longer alpha helix regions
• triple stranded beta sheets
• increased ionic interactions between amino acid
side chains (H & non-covalent bonds)
• larger quantities of aa like proline
• tighter folding
• due to more hydrophobic core
• reduces surface area to volume ratio.
Not ALL proteins from Thermophiles are
thermostable
• High turnover rate
• Protein synthesis is very fast to replace
damaged protein
• Chaperones help refold damaged proteins
• DNA has higher melting point
• Polymerases are heatstable
• e.g. Taq polymerase
Chaperones
• a.k.a. Heat shock
proteins
• DnaK, DnaJ, Grp E, GroEL, GroES
• Recognise unfolded proteins
• Prevent or reverse incorrect
folding

temp
• Also protect against other
stresses

Effects of Freezing
• What happens when you freeze a
solution?
• Water freezes forming ice crystals
• As water turns to ice concentration of cell
contents rises
• What happens to the Aw?
• The Aw falls
• What happens in cells?
• Ice expands volume ruptures cell
• Creates shear forces that disrupt the cell
• Cell death due to combination of
mechanical damage and low Aw.
Cold Osmotic Shock (COS)
• Dilute cell suspension from isotonic medium at
37OC into 100 volumes of ice cold hypotonic
diluent.
• e.g. 1.0 ml of broth culture at 37OC added to 99.0 ml
sterile distilled water at 0OC.
• Rapid loss of viability: 99.999% in 5 to 10 minutes.
Protection against loss of viability
• Use of cryoprotectants
• Examples include:Glycerol, skimmed milk, DMSO
• Hydrate in solutions & weaken crystallization
• Enter cell and balance osmotic pressure &
• Relieve shrinkage & swelling damage during
freezing & thawing.

Cold Environment
• Thermal inactivation of enzymes faster than
rates of activation
• Inadequate O2 supply to meet metabolic
demands
• Different temperature effects on
interdependent metabolic reactions
(“reaction uncoupling”)
• Membrane structure alterations
• Freezing
Freezing
• Drastic reduction in gas diffusion
– liquid water vs. solid water
• Drastic reduction in enzyme function
– Reduced molecular mobility
• Structural disruption of enzymes
• Mechanical disruption of cell membranes
• Osmotic dehydration due to freezing of
extracellular water
– Most important factor
Ectotherms in Cold Environments
1. Regional heterothermy:
• different temperatures
in different parts of body
(e.g., tuna, sharks)
• Counter-current
exchange through rete
mirabilia
2. Supercooling:
• water in body cooled to below freezing
• No ice formation at bottom of large water
bodies
• Example: deep water fish of Hebron Fjord
• super-cool (-1.5 °C)
• Lack of nucleating agents prevent freezing
• Enhanced by addition of solutes to aqueous
solution
•  [solutes],  freezing point
Freezing point depression e.g. insects:
• Produce high levels of glycerol
• Lowers freezing point
• Willow gallfly larvae can supercool to –60 °C
3. Anti-freeze in blood:
• Surface dwelling fish of Hebron Fjord produce
glycoproteins & polypeptides

4. Freeze tolerance: formation of ice in extracellular fluid:
• Antifreeze inside cells
• Cells maintained by anaerobic metabolism
• Allows shallow hibernation in frogs (Benefits?)
• Examples: wood-frog & spring peepers use glucose as antifreeze
Many freeze tolerant organisms have ice-nucleating agents:
• Promotes ice-crystal formation in extracellular fluid
• Draws water out of cells,  intracellular concentrations &  freezing point
• Helps prevent crystal formation inside cells
• Prevents mechanical damage

Endothermic Mechanisms of
Thermoregulation
• Thermogenesis
• Insulation
• Migration & Modification of microclimate
• Hibernation &Torpor
• Alterations in Body Size & Metabolism
• Appendages
• Regional heterothermy, coloration,
counter-current heat exchange
Endotherms in Cold Environments
5. Thermogenesis:
• Shivering:
• brief contractions of antagonistic muscle groups produces heat
without motion
• Non-shivering thermogenesis:
• fat metabolized to produce heat; regulated by sympathetic nervous
system
6. Insulation:
• Hair, feathers;
• Pilomotor control
• Shedding/moulting allows seasonal changes
• Blubber
• Metabolically inactive
• Vasoconstriction reduces heat loss
7. Migration: seasonal long distance movements (e.g.,
gray whale)
• Spend summer at polar ice caps eating krill
• Store energy as blubber
• Spend winter in tropics; females bear & nurse young
8. Torpor: adaptive hypothermia (e.g. chickadees)
• Fat stores accumulated during day supply energy for
cold nights
• Stored fat not enough to survive night without torpor
Endotherms in Cold Environments
Hypothermia
• Animal turns down
metabolism -> cooling
• Wake from hypothermia
occassionally during
hibernation
• Can thermoregulate if
temperatures fall to levels
too low
• Prepare: fat storage
• Mammals
• Rare in birds but some
examples
Controlled hypothermia
Temp decreases but not to
ambient temperature:
• Black-capped Chickadee:
temperature decrease by 7oC
• Conserves up to 25% of
energy
• Bear: temperatures decrease
to 31-33oC
• Not “true” hibernation
• = winter sleep
Temperature Regulation in Cold Environments…A
cooler look!
Option 1 – Controlled Hypothermia (Dormancy or
Torpor):
Hibernation: In winter
• Animal lowers body temperature a significant amount:
• temperature remains at lower level for several days
• Some animals store energy as body fat to survive
hibernation period, others store food
• Animals wake up periodically.
• Those that store food do eat food during periods of
wakefulness.
• Smaller mammals: longer periods at low body temperature
• Males enter hibernation earlier than females & terminate
hibernation earlier than females
Winter Sleep:
• Some Carnivora, e.g.
Bears, raccoons, badgers
• Body temperature only
decreased by 5-6 C
• animals store large
amounts of body fat so
can maintain higher
metabolic rates during
winter & live off fat stores
Daily Torpor
• significant decrease in body
temperature for part of day
• decrease occurs during normal
sleep time
• may occur on consecutive days
• Decrease in T not as great as in
hibernators
• usually to about 15 C
Thermoregulation in Cold Environments
Hibernation – Estivation – Daily torpor Cycle
• A means to escape the
demands of homeothermy
– Torpor
– Controlled hypothermia
• Body temperature falls to
close to approximate
ambient temperatures
• During winter ->
hibernation
• During summer -> estivation
• During certain part of day ->
daily torpor
Option 2 - Body Size and Metabolism:
• Bergmann’s Rule –mammals from colder climates tend to be
larger than similar/same species from warmer climates
• Surface to Volume ratios
• Body mass may change seasonally
• Consequences of long thin shape
Arctic Fox Fennec Fox
Thermoregulation in Cold Environments
Option 3 - Insulation Changes:
• Increase in thickness of fur
• Increase in thickness of subcutaneous fat layer
• Increase in insulation decreases Lower Critical Temperature
• Upper Critical Temperature may also be lowered
e.g. Arctic fox:
• LCT of –40C in winter; decreased need for food in a cold
environment
Thermoregulation in Cold Environments
Arctic Fox (summer)Arctic Fox (winter)
Option 4 – Appendages:
• Allen’s Rule – Appendages of mammals in colder environments
are shorter than those of animals of same species found in
warmer climates
• Regional Heterothermy & Countercurrent heat exchange:
• Found in nose, legs, tails, ears, flipper of marine mammals
Thermoregulation in Cold Environments
Option 5 – Coloration:
• Gloger’s rule: species in warm and humid areas are more
heavily pigmented than those in cool and dry areas
• Color change in some mammals
• White coloration in many arctic mammals; a thermal
advantage?

Option 6 - Modification of
Microclimates:
• Nest building
• Huddling behavior
• Both conserve body heat by
increasing insulation
Option 7 - An Increase in
Thermogenic Capacity:
• Non-shivering Thermogenesis
• Brown Fat: rich in mitochondria
• Stimulated by Norepinephrine

Controlling body temperature
• Animals with large surface area compared to their
volume will lose heat faster than animals with small
surface area
Poikilothermy - Ectothermy
• Most common
• all invertebrates
• many vertebrates
• animal’s body temperature
varies with environment
Terrestrial animals:
• can adjust body temperature
with behaviour (basking in sun,
resting underground etc.)
Eurythermal:
• function over wide range of
temp
Stenothermal:
• function over narrow range of
temp
Metabolic Rate:
• Rate that an animal consumes
chemical energy
• heat energy released, O2
consumed, or CO2 produced
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):
• Metabolic rate at rest with no
temperature stress or digestion
occurring
Basic functioning of vital organs:
• liver (27%), brain (19%), muscles
(18%), kidneys (10%), heart (7%)
Thermoregulation
Thermoneutral zone:
• range of ambient
temperatures where BMR
maintained
Lower critical temperature:
• animal must increase
metabolic heat production
to maintain temperature
Upper critical temperature:
• animal must use
evaporative heat loss to
maintain temperature

Require
“evaporative
cooling”:
• Sweating
• Panting
• Saliva
Spreading, e.g.
Cat
•Allow body temperature to increase
• animal becomes hyperthermic
•uses controlled hyperthermia
e.g. Camel:
•Thick fur on top of body: shade
•Thin fur elsewhere: easy heat loss
•Large surface area to volume
ratio: maximises heat loss
•Can go for a long time without water: lose
little through urination sweating
•Can tolerate body temperatures up to 42°C.
•Slit-like nostrils & two rows of eyelashes:
keep the sand out
What mechanisms are there to cool the
body down?
Sweating:
• Evaporation of water
from surface of skin to
cool body
• Electrolytes also lost in
sweat
Panting
• Rapid, shallow breathing
• Evaporates water from upper
respiratory tract
• Used by many carnivores &
ungulates
• Panting animals do not lose
electrolytes
Endothermy in Insects
• At rest, not enough heat produced
to warm up insect
• Heat usually produced by flight
muscles
• Higher temperature, more efficient
flying -> more energy & heat
produced
Temporal & spatial heterothermy:
• Endothermy when active only
– thorax muscles
– control blood circulation from
thorax to abdomen
– varying degree of body
insulation
– controlling muscle activity
e.g: bumble bee:
• flight muscles used for shivering
• warm themselves before able to fly
(sun exposure & shivering)
• flight maintains warmth
Warm-bodied fishes
• Larger predator sharks &
tunas have muscles which
with a higher temperature
than body
• Need to swim vigorously in
order to catch fast prey
Have:
– higher metabolic rate in
these muscles -> heat
production
– in order not to lose it
through blood circulation ->
counter-current mechanism

An introduction to tropical
rain forests.
2
- European knowledge of tropical forests began
when Alexander the Great crossed the Khyber pass
in 327 BC, into the Punjab. ‘His army saw mangrove
swamps (which upset their view of trees), jackfruit,
mangoes, bananas, cotton and Banyans’.
These amazing observations were incorporated in the
Enquiry into plants of Theophrastus, philosopher and
pupil of Plato and Aristotle, to become part of the general
knowledge of plants, copied, corrupted, and not improved
upon for nearly 2,000 years until the exploration of the
16/17th Centuries and the subsequent colonial era!.

- The word jungle, still often in use, is derived from
the Hindi word jangal a reference to the dense
impenetrable forest and scrub around settlements.
- During the 20th C knowledge of rain forests
developed in two streams.
1) Academics continued to collect and identify and study
the plants, animals and the forest structure. This phase of
study was summarised with the publication of a superb
study by P.W. Richards who summed up all studies prior
to 1940.
2) Colonial foresters began to delimit blocks of forest to be
preserved from felling for agriculture, to control the use of
forests for timber and to develop silviculture
5
- In recent decades, these two streams of knowledge
have slowly merged.
- It must also be borne in mind that apart from
Western knowledge of tropical rain forests men have lived
in this ecosystem for thousands of years.
- Since the 1950s the technology to build roads, fell
trees and clear land have made it possible to remove tropical
rain forests at a rate that was previously unheard of!
- The current worry is whether these forests be sustained
in the current economic and political climate in the majority
of tropical countries?
6
WHAT ARE TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS?
- In 1898 a German botanist AFW Schimper wrote a
classic tome (English: 1903) entitled ‘Plant geography
upon an ecological basis’, which summarised 100 years
of tropical exploration. It is to Schimper that we owe the
term tropical rain forest (tropische Regenwald) for the
forests of the permanently wet tropics.
- Four major sorts of woody vegetation in the
tropics:
3) rain forests
4) monsoon forests
5) savanna forests
6) thorn forests
7
- These groupings have since been refined into
several subdivisions which are termed formations.
- The various tropical rain forest formations constitute
the most structurally complex and diverse land
ecosystems ever to have existed on earth, with the greatest
numbers of co-existing plant and animal species. In
species diversity the tropical rain forests are only
rivalled by the coral reefs.
Climate
- Constant high temp in which the mean temp of the
coolest month is 18oC is one definition.
8
- This excludes some tropical montane forest and
a difference of less than 5oC between the mean temp
of the hottest and coldest months of the year is often used
as an alternative definition.
- Rainfall is of course the second most important
factor, its amount and its distribution throughout the year.
- Rain forests develop where every month is wet (with
10cm rainfall or more), or there are only short dry periods
which occur mainly as unpredictable spells lasting only a
few days or weeks.
9
- The blanket term tropical moist forest was coined
in 1976 to cover both rain and monsoon forests,
Schimper’s first two great groupings which together
comprise the tall, closed-canopy forests of the wet tropics.
- The climate in various parts of the rain forest belt are
shown in figure 2. (climate diagrams: devised by Walter
and Leith, 1967)
- Note the distinction between places within the rain
forest belt between places with no dry season (e.g. much of
the Indo-Malayan forests and the western Amazon), and
those where there is a slight dry season (e.g. West Africa
and the eastern Amazon).

- Within a forest in general terms it is cool, humid and
dark near the floor of a mature patch of forest,
progressively altering upwards towards the canopy top.
Different plant and animal species have become specialised
to the various forest interior microclimates.
Occurrence of tropical rain forests
- Tropical rain forests occur in Africa, Asia and
America. The most extensive, about half the world total

- The second largest block is in the Eastern tropics
(2.5 X 106 km2) and is centred on the Malay archipelago,
the region known to botanists as ‘Malesia’.
- Indonesia occupies most of the archipelago and is
second only to Brazil in the amount of rain forest it
possesses.
- The Eastern rain forests extend beyond Malesia into
the Pacific and southwards as a narrow broken coastal
strip in Queensland, NE Australia (mangrove lecture).
- The Malesian forests extend northwards up the
Malay peninsula into continental Southeast Asia, Burma,
Thailand, and Indo-China.
15
- There are also outliers, in SW Sri Lanka and
the Western Ghats of Southern India where seasonality is
strong.
- Africa has the smallest block of tropical rain forest,
1.8 X 106 km2. This is centred on the Congo basin,
reaching from the high mountains at its Eastern limit
westwards to the Atlantic Ocean, with outliers in East
Africa.
16
Forest formations
- There is considerable variation from place to place
in the rain forest mantle due to the distinct forest
formations.
- A forest formation, is recognized by a particular
combination of vegetation structure regardless of flora.
Convergent evolution has occurred because different
species in the three tropical land areas have evolved similar
responses to the same environmental stimuli.
- The forest formations occupy different physical
habitats and these are mostly sharply bounded, where
this is not so, there is a merging zone.
17
- Rain forest formations can be grouped for
convenience according to the main physical
characteristics of their habitats (see figure 5).
Introduction to most common/extensive
forest formations
Tropical lowland evergreen rain forest
Description:
- This is the most luxuriant of all plant communities.
Lofty, dense 45m tall, characterised by many tree species
which occur together.

- This formation is conventionally regarded as having
three layers: the top layer of individual or grouped
giant emergent tress, over a main stratum (24-36 m ) with
smaller, shade-dwelling trees below that. Ground veg. is
sparse. Some of the biggest trees have clear boles of 30m
and reach 4.5m in girth and can be deciduous or semi-
deciduous without affecting the evergreen nature of the
canopy.
- Boles are usually almost cylindrical, buttresses are
common. All other rain forest formations differ from this in
having simpler structure with less biodiversity.
36
Habitat and occurrence:
- Tropical lowland evergreen rain forest occurs in
per humid lowland climates where water stress is
intermittent or absent, from sea-level to 1200 m on dryland
sites. It is the main lowland formation of the Eastern tropics.
TROPICAL SEMI-EVERGREEN RAIN FOREST
Description:
- Semi-evergreen rain forest is a closed, high forest
in which the biggest emergent trees sometimes reach 45 m
in height! It includes both evergreen and, in the top of the
canopy, deciduous trees, in an intimate mixture.
37
- Deciduous trees may comprise up to 1/3 of the
taller trees, though not all are necessarily leafless at the
same time. The number of species is high, but less so
than in evergreen rain forest. Buttresses continue to
be frequent and occur in both evergreen and deciduous
species. Bark tends to be thicker. The canopy is sometimes
locally stratified. Big woody climbers tend to be very
abundant. Bamboos are present. Epiphytes are occasional
to frequent and include many ferns and orchids.
Habitat and occurrence:
Where there is a regular annual period of moisture stress
this replaces the previous formation. It occupies most of
the African forest block, including all of the Congo basin.
38
- It occurs as a narrow fringe around the main
Eastern rain forest block, and also forms the outlier
in India, and most of the Australian tropical rain forest.
The montane rain forest
Description and habitat:
- If you climb a tropical mountain you will encounter
forests of different structures and physiogamy. The
most dramatic change, which usually occurs over a short
distance, is from mesophyll-dominated forest with an
uneven billowing canopy surface to a lower, more even,
often pale-coloured, microphyll-dominated canopy, of more
slender trees, usually with gnarled limbs and very dense
subcrowns. See figure 8 for forest zones on a tropical
mountain.

42
- This is ‘classic’ upper montane rain forest. This
formation is often only 10 m tall or less. Trees in this
formation are often swathed in bryophytes and filmy ferns
and the formation is then known as mossy forest (though
liverworts predominate). Sphagnum moss is also common.
- On small mountains upper montane rain forest abuts
on lowland rain forest, but on bigger ones an intermediate
formation, lower montane rain forest, occurs.
Occurrence:
- The Eastern tropics are very mountainous and many
descriptions exist of the extensive montane forests and
their zonation.
43
Heath forest
Description:
E.F. Brunig the world expert on Asian heath forests, wrote
a lyrical description of the Bako National Park, Sarawak,
Malaysia “ Even the botanically inexperienced casual
wanderer will notice the change when he enters the
kerangas forest …. The storey formed by large saplings
and small poles predominates and forms a tidy and orderly
but forbidding phalanx which is dense and often difficult
to penetrate. The canopy is low, uniform and usually
densely closed with no trace of layering ……brownish and
reddish colours prevail in the foliage of the upper part of
the canopy”.
44
- He also recorded the predominance of microphylls
over mesophylls. Big woody climbers are rare, but not
slender wiry ones. Epiphytes are common and
insectivorous plants are also frequently found, including
in Asia the pitcher plants Nepenthes.
Habitat and occurrence:
- Heath forest occurs on soils developed from
siliceous sand, either coastal alluvium or weathered
sandstones. Such soils are coarse in texture and freely
draining. The most extensive heath forests are in the upper
reaches of the Rio Negro and Rio Orinoco in South America
Other large expanses of heath forest exist in Kalimantan,
Sarawak and Brunei (Forest fires, 1997).
45
Peat swamp forest
Description:
- This is a forest formation defined more on its
special habitat than on structure and physiogamy. The
Eastern peat swamp forests have a limited and distinctive
flora.
Habitat and occurrence:
- In parts of Sumatra, southern Thailand, Malaysia,
Mindanao, and west New Guinea peat swamp forest is
common.
46
Freshwater swamp forests
Description:
- Like the peat swamp forests these are defined mainly
on habitat. They are a very diverse assemblage of forest
types flooded by river water, hence richer in plant nutrients
than peat swamp forest.
Habitat and occurrence:
- The Amazon, which has annual floods and is also
influenced by tides to some 900 km from the mouth, has
very extensive and diverse fresh-water permanent and
periodic swamp forests. Approx 1/3 of the Congo basin is
occupied by swamp forests.
47
Forest turnover
- This is the term used to describe the process by
which old trees die or are blown down/lightning strike etc
which creates a gap in the canopy which allows sapling a
chance.
Canopy layers
- The term forest canopy can be taken to cover the
entire above ground plant community. This plethora of
species is commonly described as being layered or
stratified. See figures 11 & 12.

- A mature lowland rain forest has trees of many sizes.
The tallest which stand ‘head and shoulders’ above the rest
are known as emergents. They occur either alone or as
groups.
Single kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra), which reach immense
size in Amazonia, are a common and conspicuous sight
when viewed from the river (See figure 13). By contrast, the
billowing canopy of a west Malesian forest results from
groups of emergent Dipterocarpaceae.

52
Floristics
- The humid tropics are extremely rich in plant life.
About 2/3 (170, 000) of the worlds angiosperm species
occur in the tropics. Half of these are in the New World
south of the Mexico/US frontier, 21,000 in tropical Africa
and 50, 000 in tropical and subtropical Asia, with
36, 000 in Malesia.
- There are similarities especially at family level,
between all three blocks of tropical rain forest, but there
are fewer genera in common and not many species.

Plant Life
- The exuberance of plant life in the humid tropics
continues to dazzle scientists (as I was during my time
in Malaysia) from more sober temperate climates.
- Trees have a great diversity of form and size and
some have the uniquely tropical attributes of huge
buttresses or trunk-borne flowers. They support a wealth
of climbers and epiphytes. Aroids, Bamboos, palms,
cyclanths, pandans, stranglers and banyans
add extra dimensions

INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND ANIMALS
- The interactions between flora and fauna which
inhabit the tropical rain forest are far more complex than
in temperate forests and include areas such as:
7) animals as pollinators
8) animals as dispersers
9) symbioses
10) co-evolution
and many others.
62
Forest conversion to other land usages
- Agriculture:
Agriculture is the main purpose for which rain forests
are cleared. There are several major kinds of agriculture
and their impact varies from place to place. In many
areas in South America they are felled and converted into
pasture for cattle.
Rain forests have also been felled and replaced by
plantation tree crops, principally rubber and oil palm
(Hevea brasiliensis, Elaesis guineensis) with cocoa
(Theobroma cacao) taking third place. This form of
conversion has and is having a major impact in Malaysia!
