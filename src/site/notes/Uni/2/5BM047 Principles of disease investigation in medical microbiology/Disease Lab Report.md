## Introduction (well referenced )
#### Background on the topic  
UTI is a bacterial infection of the bladder and associated structure
among the most common bacterial infections encountered in clinical practice
primarily affect the lower urinary tract
Typical UTI symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort, and dysuria
(Bono, Reygaert and Leslie, 2025)

#### brief detail of the case study
While visiting Sri Lanka John Smith was delivered to the emergency room having collapsed at the air port. He later stated that he had been experiencing "a continuous urge to urinate and pronounced discomfort" as well as "dizzy spells" and potentially haematuria. After examination he was noted to have a BMI of over 35 (considered obese) which he claims is caused by excessive consumption of fast food and a lack of excersise. When admitted to the hospital his blood and urine was taken for analysis, the latter of which was requested to undergo a microbiological analysis.

#### Key stats and figures  
United States there were 10.5 million ambulatory visits for UTI, accounting for 0.9% of all ambulatory visits.
Among men, culture of a random initial void will find 1% to 5% colonized with _Escherichia coli_; urethral colonization is higher among men whose female sex partner has a UTI.4 Among women, urinary colonization rates are higher; the vaginal cavity and rectal opening are close to the urethral
In a Michigan study following 285 college women with first UTI for 6 months, the risk of a second was 24% within 6 months.
(Foxman, 2014)

affecting  150 million people worldwide each year
(McLellan and Hunstad, 2016)

Mortality following an uncomplicated UTI is close to zero.
(Bono, Reygaert and Leslie, 2025)

Uropathogenic _Escherichia coli_ (UPEC) cause 85% or more of uncomplicated UTI cases, while other Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci, such as _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_ and enterococci, are responsible for the remaining 5–15%
(O’Brien et al., 2016)

UTIs in the overall population were the second most common cause for antibiotic prescribing in primary care
(ROSELLO et al., 2017)

Globally, in 2019, an estimated 4.95 million deaths were associated with antimicrobial resistance, with _E. coli_ being among the primary contributors.
(Raphael et al., 2024)
#### potential methods of testing
**Urine Specimen Collection**
**Urinalysis**
**Urine Cultures**
(Bono, Reygaert and Leslie, 2025)

Microtitre tray with an inverted microscope
biochemical test strips
article counting, electrical impedance, colorimetric filtration, photometry, bioluminescence, radiometry
leucocyte esterase, nitrite, protein, and blood detection
(Public Health England, 2019)

##### What you are going to do and how
Sample 1
Centrifugation for concentration of sample
Gram stain for identification and enumeration
Dilute to 1μl
plate with spread plate technique
set up and inoculate analytical profile index
repeate gram stain from conoly growing on plate
API 20E
#### aims and objectives
Use classical determinative microbiology determine if john Smith has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and identify the organism that caused the infection

## Method And Shit
1,000μl of the urine sample was transferred into a sterile Eppendorf which was then loaded into a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for thirty minutes to sediment the bacterial cells in the sample. After removing the supernatant the cells were then resuspended, using a pipette, before being added to a clean glass slide for Gram staining.

After dipping the inoculating loop (sterilised via the blue cone of a flame) into the concentrated sample it was tapped onto the slide and used to spread said sample across the bottom two-thirds. The loop was then sterilized again while the smear dried at room temperature. Passing the slide five times through a red flame heat fixed it making it prepared for staining once cooled.

The heat-fixed smear was placed on a staining rack with a few drops of Crystal Violet on top of it, left to stain for a minute before both sides were washed with water and the crystal violet was replaced by Gram's Iodine in similar volume for two minutes. Next, the smear was decolourised using 95% ethanol, running across it drop-wise for five seconds and washed immediately. A few drops of Safranin is used to counter-stain the smear. The counter stain lasted for a minute before being washed and dried with blotting paper. This stained smear was examined under oil immersion.

A plate of Cystine–lactose–electrolyte-deficient (CLED) agar was inoculated by dipping a sterile 1μl loop into the (gently mixed) urine sample and streaking it across the whole surface of the agar. The plate was then incubated upside-down at 37°C overnight or longer.

Four dilution blanks were made containing 4,5000μl of sterile isotonic buffer. The undiluted urine sample was gently mixed and 500μl was added to the first blank and mixed via pipetting. 500μl was then withdrawn from that dilution and transferred into the second blank. Then from that dilution into a third blank and from the third to the fourth creating a 10<sup>-4</sup> dilution of the original sample.

Three CLED plates were prepared for each of the diluents (save for the first one). The 10<sup>-4</sup> tube was gently mixed and 100μl was taken from the tube onto the surface of the agar. The same was done with the other dilutions in order of increasing concentration. In the same order a disposable plastic spreader was used to spread the sample over the surface of the plates, rotating 120 degrees between each spread to cover the agar. The plates were then incubated upside-down at 37°C overnight or longer.

500μl of distilled water was dispensed into an incubation tray and an API gallery was placed inside. The sample was then pipetted into the tube section of the API 20E incubation tray and the microtubules were filled according to the manufacturers instructions. After inoculation the plastiic lid was placed on the tray and the galleries were incubated at 37°C for 18-24 hours. After the incubation the microtubules were read according to the manuffacturer-provided guide to generate the number profile for the organism

After incubation the colonies on the 1μl loop CLED plate and a whichever of the dilution plates contains between 30 and 300 colonies. A sterile loop was used to emulsify a colony from one of the plates in 10μl of water, to then be made into a Gram stain across the bottom two thirds of a glass slide to be observed under oil immersion to identify the Gram reaction and cellular morphology.

## Discussion
CLED Agar is recommended for isolation, enumeration and identification of urinary pathogens on the basis of lactose fermentation
Bromothymol blue change to yellow in case of acid production during fermentation of lactose...Lactose-positive bacteria build yellow colonies
(55420 CLED Agar (Cystine-Lactose-Electrolyte Deficient Agar; Bromothymol- blue Lactose Cystine Agar), n.d.)
When it comes to diagnosing UTIs, chromogenic UTI agar has several benefits over traditional techniques, such as high accuracy, enhanced detection of polymicrobial infections, and cost-effectiveness. The research backs up the inclusion of chromogenic medium in standard UTI diagnosis procedures.
(Vadivelu et al., 2025)
CLED gave the  sensitivity (78%), for _E coli_
E. coli is more antibiotic resistant than other uropathogens
(Raphael et al., 2024)

| This report regards only uncomplicated UTIs. A UTI (urinary tract infection) is one of the most frequent causes of bacterial infections in clinical practice (it affects more than 150 million people worldwide (McLellan and Hunstad, 2016)) and involves the bladder or is associated structures (primarily the lower urinary tract). Symptoms usually include polyuria, discomfort, and dysuria. (Bono, Reygaert and Leslie, 2025) In 2016 uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) accounted for more than 85% of UTI cases (O'brien et al., 2016).<br><br>![](file:///C:/Users/dange/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.png)<br><br>Figure 1: A pie chart showing the proportion of UTIs that are caused by different uropathogens, note that UPEC (uropathogenic Escherichia coli) is the majority of infectants (Flores-Mireles et al., 2015)<br><br>In the case of John Smith, found passed out after experiencing dizzy spells, discomfort, the continuous urge to urinate and potential haematuria, blood and urine samples were taken. The latter was requested for microbiological analysis to determine if he had a UTI.<br><br>In The United States 10.5 million ambulatory visits (0.9%) were UTI related. Women have higher UTI rates which increases the rates among sexually active males.

| 1,000μl of urine sample was transferred into an Eppendorf which was loaded into a centrifuge at 6000 rpm for thirty minutes, sedimenting the bacteria. After removing the supernatant the cells were resuspended, with a pipette, before being added to a clean glass slide to be Gram stained. After dipping the inoculating loop (sterilised via the blue cone of a flame) into the concentrated sample, it was tapped onto the slide and used to spread to spread said sample across the bottom two-thirds. The loop was then sterilised again while the smear dried at room temperature. Passing the slide five times through a red flame heat fixed it making it prepared for staining.<br><br> The cooled smear was placed on a staining rack with a few drops of Crystal Violet on top, left to stain for one minute before both sides were washed with water and the Crystal Violet was replaced by a similar volume of Gram's Iodine. Next, the smear was decolourised using 95% ethanol, running across it drop wise for five seconds and washed. A few drops of Safranin is used to counter-stain the smear. This lasted a minute before being washed and dried with blotting paper. The stain was examined under oil immersion.<br><br> A plate of cystine-lactose-electrolyte deficient (CLED) agar was inoculated according to the Hardy Diagnostics guidelines.<br><br> Four dilution blanks were made from 4,500μl of sterile isotonic buffer. The undiluted sample was mixed and 500μl was withdrawn from that dilution to be transferred into the second dilutant. Then from that dilution into a third blank, and from the third into the final tube creating a 10-4 dilution of the original sample.<br><br> Three CLED plates were prepared (one for each dilution except the first). The 10-4 tube was homogenised and 100μl was distributed from the tube onto the surface of the agar. The same was done with the other dilutions in order of increasing concentration. In the same order a disposable plastic spreader was used to spread the sample over the surface of the plates, rotating 120° between each spread to cover the agar. The plates were then incubated inverted at 37°C overnight or longer.<br><br> 500μl of distilled water was added to an incubation tray along with an API gallery. the sample was then pipetted into the tube section of the API 20E incubation tray and the microtubules were filled according to the manufacturers instructions. After inoculation the tray was capped and the API was incubated at 37°C overnight or longer.  Then the microtubules were read and filled according to the manufacturer-provided guide to generate the number profile for the organism.<br><br> After incubation the colonies on the 1μl loop CLED plate and whichever dilution plate contains between 30 and 3000 colonies were counted. A sterile loop was used to emulsify a colony from one of the plates in 10μl of water, to then be made into a gram stain across the bottom two-thirds of a glass slide to be observed under oil immersion to identify the Gram reaction and cellular morphology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [What do the results indicate, what is their significance and how do they compare to theory]<br><br>The plates showed that the infecting organism was E. coli, one of the ways this can be proven is with the yellow coloured colonies CLED agar is best for this because lactose fermentation differentiates the different uropathogens well. The bromothymol blue changes colonies yellow when they ferment the lactose in the agar (55420 CLED Agar (Cystine-Lactose-Electrolyte Deficient Agar; Bromothymol- blue Lactose Cystine Agar), n.d.)
