## The Fungi that kills you

### Fungi classification
• Fungi are eukaryotic organisms including microorganisms such as yeasts, moulds and mushrooms
• Classified in their own kingdom.
• Fungi are not animals, plants, or bacteria but they have complex eukaryotic cells like animals and plants.
• Fungi can occur as yeasts, moulds, or as a combination of both forms
(dimorphic fungi).
• ~300 species of the estimated 3.5 – 5.1 million fungal species are linked to human fungal diseases.

### Fungi as disease causing agents
Fungi are responsible for 1.5 million annual fatalities and have infected 1/3 of the human population
• Fungi are responsible for more human infections compared to TB, malaria or HIV
• Fungi are are capable of causing superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous, systemic or allergic diseases

### Characteristics of fungi
• Most fungi are obligate or facultative aerobes.
• Digest food externally and then ingest it.
• Most are multicellular & filamentous.
• A few are single cellular (yeasts)
• Are divided into three major groups
	✓ Multicellular filamentous moulds.
	✓ Macroscopic filamentous fungi such as Mushrooms
	✓ Single celled microscopic yeasts.

### Fungal cell wall structure
Most fungal cell wall comprises of polysaccharides (chitin, β-glucan, mannan), lipid-phosphate- protein, protease and melanin.
• Chitin is a polysaccharide composed of long chain of n- acetylglucosamine.
• Plasma membrane contains ergosterol similar to cholesterol in mammalian cells
• Ergosterol and β-glucan are common site of action of many antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B and azole compounds.
• As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus where the DNA is wrapped around histone proteins.
• Cytoplasm contains microtubules, mitochondria, lipids, endoplasmic reticulum and phosphate granules.

### Fungal pathogenesis
• Most fungi are saprophytic or parasitic to plants and are adapted to their natural environment.
• Other fungi such as Candida sp. and Malassezia sp. have adapted to human environment and exist as commensals
• Infection in humans is a chance event, occurring only when conditions are favourable.
• Human primary pathogenic fungi include dimorphic fungi causing systemic mycoses and dermatophytes causing superficial infections.

#### Virulence
• A complex interplay between fungal virulence factors and host defence factors will determine whether a fungal infection will cause a disease.
o Infection also depends on inoculum size and the immunity of the host
o Ability to adhere to host cells.
o Produce capsules that allow them to resist phagocytosis.
o Ability to acquire iron from red blood cells as in Candida albicans.
o Ability to damage host cells by secreting enzymes such as keratinase, elastase, collagenase Ability to resist killing by phagocytes as in dimorphic fungi.  
• Ability to secrete mycotoxins.  
• Exhibiting thermal dimorphism.  
• Ability to block the cell-mediated immune defences of the host.

### Moulds
• Made up of very fine threads (hyphae).
• Hyphae grow at the tip, divide repeatedly and intertwine to form a network of threads called a mycelium.
• Digestive enzymes are secreted from the hyphal tips.
• Examples of moulds include Acremonium, Mucor, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Stachybotrys (Black Mould)

### Morphology
• Hyphae - this is the basic element of filamentous fungi consisting of branched, tubular structure of 2–10 μm in width
• Mycelium - this is the web or mat-like structure of hyphae Impact of moulds on human health
• Symptoms may be mild or severe
• Symptoms include congestion, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath (asthma-like symptoms or asthma), watering or sore eyes, skin irritation or headaches.
• Some types of moulds release mycotoxins e.g Aflatoxins, which can be
absorbed by the skin or inhaled into the lungs.
• Long-term exposure to mycotoxins can result in pulmonary fibrosis, various
cancers, kidney damage etc

### Mushrooms or toadstools
• Grow by producing a mycelium below ground.
• Differ from moulds because they produce visible fruiting bodies that hold the spores.
• This fruiting body is made up of tightly packed hyphae which divide to produce the different parts of the fungal structure e.g the cap and the stem.
• Gills underneath the cap are covered with spores and a 10 cm diameter cap can produce up to 100 million spores per hour.

### Yeasts
• Small, lemon-shaped unicellular cells between 3 – 10 μm in diameter
• Facultative anaerobes.
• Reproduce either asexually (most common) or sexually.
• Asexual reproduction is through budding or binary fission.
• Sometimes yeast cells can form chains together resembling true hyphae but these
are called pseudohyphae
- Yeasts such as Saccharomyces play an important role in the production of bread and in brewing alcohol.
• Yeasts are also one of the most widely used model organisms for genetic studies, eg in
cancer research.
• Yeast like Candida sp. are opportunistic pathogens and cause infections such as candidiasis and thrush.
Yeasts colonies resemble bacterial colonies in appearance and in consistency.
• Yeast can be identified in the lab by their ability to assimilate and ferment various carbon sources and to utilize nitrate as a source of nitrogen.

### Dimorphic fungi
• These are fungi which exhibit a filamentous mycelial morphology (saprophytic phase)
when grown at room temperature 27ᴼC, but have a typical yeast morphology (parasitic
phase) inside the body and when grown at 37ᴼC in the laboratory (e.g. Histoplasmosis).

### Fungal infection (mycoses)
✓ Superficial mycoses infection is limited to the outer surface of hair shafts, skin shafts and nails e.g. Tinea versicolor, Black Piedra, White Piedra
✓ Cutaneous mycoses – Is the most common fungal infection.
o It extends deeper into the epidermis, and can include invasive hair and nail disease e.g
Dermatophytosis
✓ Subcutaneous mycoses– these are caused by saprophytic fungi which are unable to penetrate the skin.
o Often introduced into the subcutaneous tissue by a puncture wound that has been contaminated with soil e.g. Chromoblastomamycoses
o Nodules > Become ulcer > Protrude out of skin > Pus Containing drainage
✓ Systemic (deep) mycoses due to primary pathogens originate primarily in the lungs and may spread to many organ systems e.g Blastomycosis
✓ Opportunistic mycoses due to opportunistic pathogens are infections of patients with immune deficiencies

### Diagnosis of fungal infections
• Microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue (LCB) wet mount preparation.
• Culture
• Germ tube test – Candida albicans
• Urease test – Cryptococcus gattii or C. neoformans (presumptive)
• Chromagar (for yeast identification)
• Dermatophyte medium
• MALDITOF-MS
• Whole genome sequencing

### Treatment of fungal infections
#### Polyenes
• Include Amphotericin B, Nystatin and Natamycin
• These bind directly to the ergosterol in fungal cell membrane causing leakage and
cell death
• Can also bind to cholesterol of mammalian cell but at a lower affinity
• Toxic at higher therapeutic concentrations
• Have poor gut absorption
• Very effective topically
#### Echinocandins
• Examples include Caspofungin, Micafungin, Anidulafungin
• They act through the inhibition of D-glucan synthase
• They are non-toxic for mammalian cells
• Limited in application because of large molecular size

#### Azoles
• Examples include miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole
• These antifungal are usually fungistatic
• Inhibit the lanosterol demethylase enzyme for synthesis of ergosterol
• Cause inhibition of fungal growth and impartment of membrane permeability
• Complete inhibition aided by managing predisposing factors
• Completely absorbed in GIT
• Secreted in high levels in saliva

#### Allylamines
• Examples include Terbinafine, Naftifine
• Inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of squalene epoxidase
