## Introduction to Medical  Microbiology
### Role of NHS microbiology laboratory  
Responsible for:
- Diagnostic support relating to infection
- Information to support treatment choice/ patient management  
- Gram result (debridement or bloodstream infection)  
- Antibiotic susceptibility (how to treat)
- More interpretation in Micro than other disciplines - for the BMS

Diagnostic workflow: 
Sample  → Collection → Receipt → Processing → Interpretation → Report

- Contact tracing  
- Pandemic preparedness
- Guide health protection programmes e.g. vaccination  
### How samples are processed in the laboratory
- Hospital, GP, prison, and community clinics provide/collect samples 
- Specimen is then barcoded, quality checked, then goes through the LIMS (laboratory information management system) to signal that it has been received 
- Processing can be manual or automatic
- The results are then sent to Site Specific Groups (whomever it concerns)
- Further tests are then requested

## The Fungi that kills you

### Fungi classification
- Fungi are eukaryotic organisms including microorganisms such as yeasts, moulds and mushrooms
- Classified in their own kingdom.
- Fungi are not animals, plants, or bacteria but they have complex eukaryotic cells like animals and plants.
- Fungi can occur as yeasts, moulds, or as a combination of both forms
(dimorphic fungi).
- ~300 species of the estimated 3.5 - 5.1 million fungal species are linked to human fungal diseases.

### Fungi as disease causing agents
Fungi are responsible for 1.5 million annual fatalities and have infected 1/3 of the human population
- Fungi are responsible for more human infections compared to TB, malaria or HIV
- Fungi are are capable of causing superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous, systemic or allergic diseases

### Characteristics of fungi
- Most fungi are obligate or facultative aerobes.
- Digest food externally and then ingest it.
- Most are multicellular & filamentous.
- A few are single cellular (yeasts)
- Are divided into three major groups
	✓ Multicellular filamentous moulds.
	✓ Macroscopic filamentous fungi such as Mushrooms
	✓ Single celled microscopic yeasts.

### Fungal cell wall structure
Most fungal cell wall comprises of polysaccharides (chitin, β-glucan, mannan), lipid-phosphate- protein, protease and melanin.
- Chitin is a polysaccharide composed of long chain of n- acetylglucosamine.
- Plasma membrane contains ergosterol similar to cholesterol in mammalian cells
- Ergosterol and β-glucan are common site of action of many antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B and azole compounds.
- As eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus where the DNA is wrapped around histone proteins.
- Cytoplasm contains microtubules, mitochondria, lipids, endoplasmic reticulum and phosphate granules.

### Fungal pathogenesis
- Most fungi are saprophytic or parasitic to plants and are adapted to their natural environment.
- Other fungi such as Candida sp. and Malassezia sp. have adapted to human environment and exist as commensals
- Infection in humans is a chance event, occurring only when conditions are favourable.
- Human primary pathogenic fungi include dimorphic fungi causing systemic mycoses and dermatophytes causing superficial infections.

#### Virulence
- A complex interplay between fungal virulence factors and host defence factors will determine whether a fungal infection will cause a disease.
o Infection also depends on inoculum size and the immunity of the host
o Ability to adhere to host cells.
o Produce capsules that allow them to resist phagocytosis.
o Ability to acquire iron from red blood cells as in Candida albicans.
o Ability to damage host cells by secreting enzymes such as keratinase, elastase, collagenase Ability to resist killing by phagocytes as in dimorphic fungi.  
- Ability to secrete mycotoxins.  
- Exhibiting thermal dimorphism.  
- Ability to block the cell-mediated immune defences of the host.

### Moulds
- Made up of very fine threads (hyphae).
- Hyphae grow at the tip, divide repeatedly and intertwine to form a network of threads called a mycelium.
- Digestive enzymes are secreted from the hyphal tips.
- Examples of moulds include Acremonium, Mucor, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, Stachybotrys (Black Mould)

### Morphology
- Hyphae - this is the basic element of filamentous fungi consisting of branched, tubular structure of 2-10 μm in width
- Mycelium - this is the web or mat-like structure of hyphae Impact of moulds on human health
- Symptoms may be mild or severe
- Symptoms include congestion, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath (asthma-like symptoms or asthma), watering or sore eyes, skin irritation or headaches.
- Some types of moulds release mycotoxins e.g Aflatoxins, which can be
absorbed by the skin or inhaled into the lungs.
- Long-term exposure to mycotoxins can result in pulmonary fibrosis, various
cancers, kidney damage etc

### Mushrooms or toadstools
- Grow by producing a mycelium below ground.
- Differ from moulds because they produce visible fruiting bodies that hold the spores.
- This fruiting body is made up of tightly packed hyphae which divide to produce the different parts of the fungal structure e.g the cap and the stem.
- Gills underneath the cap are covered with spores and a 10 cm diameter cap can produce up to 100 million spores per hour.

### Yeasts
- Small, lemon-shaped unicellular cells between 3 - 10 μm in diameter
- Facultative anaerobes.
- Reproduce either asexually (most common) or sexually.
- Asexual reproduction is through budding or binary fission.
- Sometimes yeast cells can form chains together resembling true hyphae but these
are called pseudohyphae
- Yeasts such as Saccharomyces play an important role in the production of bread and in brewing alcohol.
- Yeasts are also one of the most widely used model organisms for genetic studies, eg in
cancer research.
- Yeast like Candida sp. are opportunistic pathogens and cause infections such as candidiasis and thrush.
Yeasts colonies resemble bacterial colonies in appearance and in consistency.
- Yeast can be identified in the lab by their ability to assimilate and ferment various carbon sources and to utilize nitrate as a source of nitrogen.

### Dimorphic fungi
- These are fungi which exhibit a filamentous mycelial morphology (saprophytic phase)
when grown at room temperature 27ᴼC, but have a typical yeast morphology (parasitic
phase) inside the body and when grown at 37ᴼC in the laboratory (e.g. Histoplasmosis).

### Terms used in colonial morphology of yeast and filamentous fungi

### Fungal infection (mycoses)
✓ Superficial mycoses infection is limited to the outer surface of hair shafts, skin shafts and nails e.g. Tinea versicolor, Black Piedra, White Piedra
✓ Cutaneous mycoses - Is the most common fungal infection.
o It extends deeper into the epidermis, and can include invasive hair and nail disease e.g
Dermatophytosis
✓ Subcutaneous mycoses- these are caused by saprophytic fungi which are unable to penetrate the skin.
o Often introduced into the subcutaneous tissue by a puncture wound that has been contaminated with soil e.g. Chromoblastomamycoses
o Nodules > Become ulcer > Protrude out of skin > Pus Containing drainage
✓ Systemic (deep) mycoses due to primary pathogens originate primarily in the lungs and may spread to many organ systems e.g Blastomycosis
✓ Opportunistic mycoses due to opportunistic pathogens are infections of patients with immune deficiencies

### Diagnosis of fungal infections
- Microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue (LCB) wet mount preparation.
- Culture
- Germ tube test - Candida albicans
- Urease test - Cryptococcus gattii or C. neoformans (presumptive)
- Chromagar (for yeast identification)
- Dermatophyte medium
- MALDITOF-MS
- Whole genome sequencing

### Treatment of fungal infections
#### Polyenes
- Include Amphotericin B, Nystatin and Natamycin
- These bind directly to the ergosterol in fungal cell membrane causing leakage and
cell death
- Can also bind to cholesterol of mammalian cell but at a lower affinity
- Toxic at higher therapeutic concentrations
- Have poor gut absorption
- Very effective topically
#### Echinocandins
- Examples include Caspofungin, Micafungin, Anidulafungin
- They act through the inhibition of D-glucan synthase
- They are non-toxic for mammalian cells
- Limited in application because of large molecular size

#### Azoles
- Examples include miconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole
- These antifungal are usually fungistatic
- Inhibit the lanosterol demethylase enzyme for synthesis of ergosterol
- Cause inhibition of fungal growth and impartment of membrane permeability
- Complete inhibition aided by managing predisposing factors
- Completely absorbed in GIT
- Secreted in high levels in saliva

#### Allylamines
- Examples include Terbinafine, Naftifine
- Inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of squalene epoxidase

#### Bloodstream infections
- Blood is sterile, consists of plasma and cells
- The presence of a pathogen in the bloodstream can result in:
	- Bacteraemia
	- Viraemia
	- Fungaemia
	- Parasitaemia
- Pathogens can access the bloodstream via:
	- Kidneys (ascending UTI)
	- Infection of tissues e.g., wound/bite
	- Lungs (during pneumonia infection)
##### Types of Bloodstream infections
1. Transient
	- Presence of bugs for several minutes rapid removal by immune system
	- After dental extraction, urinary catheterisation
2. Intermittent
	- Recurrent transient bacteraemia negative blood cultures
3. Continuous
	- Infection that has overwhelmed host defences (cannot be cleared from bloodstream)

- BSI = Bacteria/Fungi in blood plus clinical signs and symptoms of pathogen invasion and toxin production
- Full-blown sepsis can develop if not treated quickly Sepsis
- Is defined as a life threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection.
	- Body’s early response to injury or infection
- At least two of the following symptoms:
	- Body temp above/below normal (<36°C/ >38.3°C)
	- Heart rate >90 beats per minute
	- Hyperventilation >20 breaths per minute
	- White blood cell count >12,000 cells/μL (high) or <4000 cells per μL (low) Levi MM et al 2003
#### Sepsis
- 20% of cases associated with bacteraemia
- 80% are secondary to infection at other sites
- ↑ incidence
- Mortality rate 35-65%
- Early and appropriate empirical antibiotics plus fluids
	- ↓ mortality rates
	- Improved clinical outcomes
##### Severe sepsis
- Dysfunction of ≥ 1 organ plus hypotension
##### Septic shock
- Severe sepsis → extreme low hypotension
- All associated with high mortality
	- Each hour of delay in antibiotic treatment results in increased mortality
- Accurate and timely lab diagnosis needed
###### Septic shock symptoms
Additional symptoms include
- Extremely low blood pressure
- Little or no urine output
- Heart palpitations
- Skin rash
- Cool and pale limbs
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
- Involve both excessive bleeding and clotting
- Thrombosis obstruction of blood supply to organs/tissues That Can lead to:
	- Necrosis of renal cortex/adrenal glands
	-  Gangrene of fingers/toes
	-  Bleeding into subcutaneous tissues
- This can lead to Hypotension/shock, Organ failure
	- Very poor prognosis

![Pasted image 20260101145130.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101145130.png)

###### Treatment of Sepsis
- Involve both broad-spectrum antibiotics
- But once clinical diagnosis made
- Switched to more targeted agents
	- Once more information available about organism in the blood culture
- Start to see ↓ inflammatory response (measure CRP, serum lactate)
- Supportive therapy relative to patient’s symptoms and condition

### Hearts

### Infective endocarditis
- Infectious endocarditis is the inflammation of the endocardium, the inner lining of the heart, as well as the valves that separate each of the four chambers within the heart
- Rare: <10 per100,000 population
- Usually occurs in individuals with congenital heart defect or prosthetic valve where there is turbulent blood flow
	- Endothelial damage body attempts to heal wound accumulation of platelets fibrin clot deposited
	- Organisms entering the bloodstream attach infected vegetations
- Tends to be difficult to treat with antimicrobial therapy
	- Viable bacteria deep within vegetation

## Central Nervous System infections Blood, Hearts and Brains

### Brain, Spinal cord and meninges
- Brain and spinal cord protected by skull and spinal column (physical barrier).
	- Barriers to spread of infection
- Walls of skull and spinal column contain blood vessels and nerves.
	- Main routes of invasion by pathogens
#### Cellular barriers to Pathogen invasion
- Tightly joined cells act as a cellular barrier to blood-borne invasion.
- Invasion occurs by crossing:
	- Blood-Brain Barrier to cause encephalitis (inflammation of brain white matter).
	- Blood-CSF Barrier to cause meningitis (inflammation of the meninges surrounding the brain).
#### CNS invasion
- Pathogens cross the cellular barriers by
	- Growing across, infecting cells that comprise the barrier
	-  Passively transported across in intracellular vacuoles
	-  Carried across by infected WBCs
- Certain viruses e.g., HSV, VZV, rabies
	- Invade via peripheral nerves
#### Host response to CSF invasion
1. Viral invasion - aseptic meningitis
	- ↑lymphocytes, ↑protein in cerebrospinal fluid (marginal increase)
	- Clear CSF
2. Pyogenic bacterial invasion - septic meningitis
	- ↑↑↑neutrophils, ↑↑↑ protein in CSF
	- Visibly turbid CSF
3. Slower growing/less pyogenic bacteria
	- Less spectacular changes e.g., TB, Listeria
##### Predisposing factors
- Congenital malformations
- Trauma e.g., basal skull fracture
- Presence of CSF shunts/cochlear implants
- Infection of middle ear or paranasal sinuses
- Immunodeficiency

![Pasted image 20260101145701.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101145701.png)

#### Treatment for meningitis
- Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency
- Give antibiotics immediately!!!
- Ceftriaxone (chloramphenicol if penicillin allergic)
- Once pathogen known, antibiotic therapy can be modified for optimum treatment - e.g. change to amoxicillin/ampicillin for GBS
- Prophylaxis given to close contacts
### Viral CNS infections
1. Meningitis
	- Milder than bacterial meningitis
	- Headache, fever, but less neck stiffness
	- Commonest: non-polio human enteroviruses
2. Encephalitis
- Commonly caused by Herpes Simplex Virus
- 70% mortality in untreated patients
- Early and prolonged (21 day) IV acyclovir treatment to prevent relapse
- Others e.g., Rabies, JEV, West Nile virus
### Fungal meningitis
- Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of fungal meningitis
- Other pathogens include Coccidioides, Blastomyces and Histoplasma
- Cryptococcal meningitis is an AIDS defining infection but it can also be seen in immunocompetent individuals
- Symptoms
	- Milder than bacterial meningitis
	- Headache, fever, vomiting and neck stiffness
- Diagnosis is usually by India ink, lateral flow, CrAg test (latex) and culture
- Treatment - Amphotericin + flucytosine or fluconazole
#### Laboratory diagnosis of fungal infections
- Lumbar puncture

## Urinary tract infections
### Introduction
- The urinary tract is essentially sterile
	- Functions to remove urine and impurities via the kidneys
- Infection only occurs from introduction of organisms into urethra or via the blood - distal end should be only contaminated part
- Spread from urinary tract to blood possible but is uncommon - very serious
- A variety of conditions are caused

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra. Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. Lets begin with a definition…..

![Pasted image 20260101145949.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101145949.png)

#### Urinary tract Host defence mechanisms
- Tamm-Horsefall protein
- Aimed towards E. coli
- prevents interaction with uroepithelium by interfering with fimbriae adhesion
- Produced by renal tubular epithelial cells
- One of most abundant proteins 

![Pasted image 20260101150110.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101150110.png)

#### Some interesting facts and figures
- UTI is common depending on age and sex
- Most common in 1st year of life
- Males predominate but females take over
- Lowest rates in 11 - 15 yrs
- Infection rates rise in females with sexual activity -at least 20% will develop infection
#### Urinary tract pathogens
- Specialist adaptations are required
- To colonise the urinary tract adhesins or intracellular habits are required
- Must resist antimicrobial action of urine
- Flushing action
- Most serious infection associated with catheters or existing damage or dysfunction

![Pasted image 20260101150135.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101150135.png)

- Other organisms also cause UTI
- Common infections are caused by fungi
- Candida albicans - genital and anal thrush -Candiasis - can be very serious if haematogenous
- Less commonly
- Fastidious organisms and Mycobacteria
- Parasites - Schistosoma haematobium

### Introduction
- Diagnosis is as only as good as the samples
- Specimen collection must take into account contamination
- Contamination taken into account during culture - more common in women
- Direct and biochemical methods used to determine presence and 
### Specimen collection
- A variety of methods exist
- Midstream urine (MSU)
- Common for adults
- Clean catch urine
- For use in children
- Pad and bag urine
- Used for young children in nappies - prone to contamination
- Invasive collection methods
- ‘in-out’ catheter urine
- Catheter inserted for sample
- Catheter stream urine (CSU)
- Taken from indwelling catheters
- port must be used
- Suprapubic aspirate
- Sample taken from the bladder with a needle - neonates
### Considerations about transport
- Urine is a really good growth media!
- Growth in sample can skew results
- 4oC for max 24 h to preserve structures
- Dip slides can be used
- Boric acid - reduces counts
### Initial processing of samples
- Dipstick tests are often used
- Determine presence of RBC, WBC and some bacteria
- Consideration needs to be given to clinical state of the patient
- Two tests used commonly
- Leucocyte esterase - neutrophils
- Nitrate reductase = UTI bacteria
- All except S. Saprophyticus
A typical dipstick test shows the presence of many things associated with infection and other disease markers
### Processing of samples
- Urine microscopy
- Used to determine the presence of cells, casts and crystals
- Cells - RBC’s, WBC’s, bacteria, epithelial cells
- Gram stain may be used
- Casts - imprints of the tubular network in the kidney
- Crystals - precipitations of the chemical constituents
- 96-well Rant-Shepherd test often used

![Pasted image 20260101150401.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101150401.png)
![Pasted image 20260101150410.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101150410.png)
- Automated methods
- Automated dipstick
- Avoids subjectivity
- Automated microscopy
- Recognises particles in urine and provides image
- Flow cytometry
- Uses a laser to ‘see’ size and shape of components
### Culture of urine samples
- Culture results are important
- Clinically significant
- Approx. - ≥105 - 106 cfu/ml may be taken as significant and indicates infection
- A cut off of 104 cfu/ml is used
- Loop and multipoint inoculation methods are used
### Common media used in urine analysis
- The work horse of the lab is Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient agar (CLED)
- Differential media that shows ability to ferment lactose
- Fermenters = yellow/red, non-fermenters = blue/cream
- May have Andrade indicator
- Prevents swarming or Proteus
- Supports growth of many organisms CLED agar is commonly used but other media such as McConkey agar and chromogenic agars are also sometimes used

### Susceptibility testing
- Significant cultures are susceptibility tested
- Influences the choice of antibiotic depending on:
- Susceptibility profile, status of the patient, cost and mode of delivery of antibiotic
- Cultural methods available - disks
- Identification and susceptibilities can be combined and automated - VITEK
### Treatment of Urinary tract infection
- A variety of antibiotic chemotherapeutics are used
- Depends on in upper or lower UT infection
- Trimethoprim and Nitrofurantoin are commonly used

## General Diseases (Week 7)
### Plasmodium
- There are approximately 156 named species of Plasmodium which infect various species of vertebrates.
- Human malaria is caused by 4 Plasmodium species
- P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae
- Now a fifth form recognised, a simian malaria parasite
- P. knowlesi (zoonotic) mostly in South-East Asia
- It’s not known if P. knowlesi is naturally transmitted from human to human via the mosquito, without the natural intermediate host Malaria
- Comes from the word “mal aria” or “bad air”
- Mistakenly thought to come from the smelly swamp air
	- Mosquito breeding grounds
- Plasmodium species were endemic in salt marshes of South-East England (1800s).
- Also after WWI, ~500 cases in Kent
	- Soldiers returning from Thessaloniki, Greece
	- You can isolate the Anopheles mosquitoes in Kent
- Transmission is possible during warmer summer months
#### Epidemiology of malaria
- 249 million cases each year with 608 000 deaths/year
- 40% of world at risk
- Africa disproportionately has a prevalence of malaria
- In 2022, 94% of the cases and 95% of the deaths were recorded in Africa
- Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%) combined had ~50% of the global cases
- 78% of the deaths were recorded in children <5yrs
- Majority of cases are due to Plasmodium falciparum

#### Who is at Risk?
- Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.
- In 2022, there were an estimated 35.4 million pregnancies in Africa, of which 12.7 million (36%) were exposed to malaria infection during pregnancy
- Malaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight
- Low birthweight is a strong risk factor for neonatal and childhood mortality
#### Travel malaria
- Backpacking / Visiting relative - Non-immune adults
- According UKHSA
- In 2023 - 2004 cases
- 2022 - 1369 cases
- 2021 - 1012 cases & 3 deaths
- (2020) - 560 cases & 5 deaths
- (2019) - 1719 cases & 6 deaths
Majority of cases are imported from Nigeria, Sierra Leone & Ghana

#### Malaria vector
- ~ 400 species & 60 are able to transmit malaria infection
	- Transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito
- Only the female bites humans
- A blood meal is required for “egg” production
- Male feeds on plant nectar
#### Important definitions
##### Sporozoite
- Slender spindle-shaped infective stage of malaria parasite
- Result of the sexual phase in mosquito
- Infects human during feeding
##### Schizont
- Stage of asexual reproduction occurring inside liver and erythrocyte cells
- A schizont is made up of numerous merozoites
##### Merozoite
- The invasive form of the parasite in erythrocytes
##### Trophozoite
- Feeding stage of protozoa
- Forms more schizonts full of merozoites
- Sexual gametocytes
##### Gametocyte
- Male (micro)
- Female (macro) stages that Enter mosquito for sexual cell cycle
##### Hypnozoite
 - Dormant stage found in the liver
 - P. vivax and P. ovale

![Pasted image 20260101151148.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101151148.png)

#### Why is malaria endemicity limited to few regions
- Malaria transmission does not occur Below 16˚C or above 33˚C or Altitudes greater than 2000 meters
- This is because sporogony in the mosquito cannot take place

#### Malaria symptoms
- Most infections only mild and self limiting
- Symptoms for severe malaria include
	- Extreme tiredness and fatigue
	- Impaired consciousness
	- Multiple convulsions
	- Difficulty breathing
	- Dark or bloody urine
	- Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)
	- Abnormal bleeding
- Malaria is characterised by cycles of Fever & Chills
	- Paroxysms (short attacks)
	- Cold Stage - Intense cold & shivering (15-60 min)
	- Hot Stage - Intense heat & burning (2-6 hrs)
	- Sweating - Profuse sweating (2-4 hrs)
- Periodicity varies with different malaria
	- Symptoms are due to the breaking down of red blood cells as parasites (merozoites) are released into circulation
#### Malaria symptoms periodicity
- P. vivax
	- 48 hrs - Tertian malaria
	- Every 3 days
- P. ovale
	- 48 hrs - Tertian malaria
	- Every 3 days
- P. malariae
	- 72 hrs - Quartan malaria
	- Every 4 days
	- Fever temp (°F)
- P. falciparum
	- 48 hrs - Tertian malaria
	- Every 3 days
	- Fever temp (°F)
### Malaria
- The number of infected erythrocytes is called the parasitaemia
	- Severity of disease correlates with parasitaemia
- Average parasitaemia
	- P. falciparum - 500,000/mm3
	- P. vivax - 20,000/mm3
	- P. ovale - 9,000/mm3
	- P. malariae - 6,000/mm3
#### Complications of malaria
- Cerebral malaria (CM)
	- Only with P. falciparum
	- Headache, drowsiness & confusion
	- Impaired consciousness & coma
- Severe anaemia
	- Only with P. falciparum
	- Each cycle of replication results in lysis of erythrocytes
	- Individual appear jaundiced
	- Oxygen carrying capability is significantly impaired
	- Repeated/chronic infection in an endemic region
- Black water fever (malaria jaundice)
	- It is characterised by intravascular haemolysis, haemoglobinuria (hemoglobulin in urine) and acute renal failure
	- Only with P. falciparum
	- Haemoglobinuria (blood in urine)
	- Individuals also appear jaundiced
- P. vivax
	- 1st time infection may be severe
	- Rarely causes death
	- Relapse of infection occurs may occur due to hypnozoites
	- Liver complications
- P. ovale
	- Mild fever of a short duration
	- Relapse of infection occurs may occur due to hypnozoites
##### Symptoms of other Malaria infections
- P. malariae
	- 1st time infection can be severe
	- Usually a mild disease
	- May be chronic with recrudescence's decades later
	- Renal complications due to antigen-antibody complexes in the glomeruli

### Anaemia pathogenesis
![Pasted image 20260101151905.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101151905.png)

#### Inside the erythrocyte
- The trophozoite digests the haemoglobin
	- Plasmepsins
	- Falcipains
- Malaria uses globin as a source of amino acids
- However, the haem is toxic
- This is polymerised into hemozoin sometimes called malaria pigment
- Many drugs target this polymerisation
##### Release from erythrocyte
- Schizonts rupture cell
- Releasing merozoites
- Each cycle destroys more cells resulting in Anaemia

### Cerebral malaria pathogenesis
#### Cerebral malaria symptoms
Only occurs with P. falciparum
- Headache
- Drowsiness
- Confusion
- Impaired consciousness & coma
- Complications can develop rapidly, and these are caused by infected Rbc blocking the capillaries in the brain
#### Sequestration
- Erythrocytes infected with developed parasites
- Leave peripheral circulation
- Sequester in blood capillaries resulting in mechanical obstruction / hypoxia
#### Mechanism
- The parasite inside the erythrocyte inserts a protein in the erythrocyte membrane
- PfEMP-1 (Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein - 1)
- Binds to CD36, ICAM-1 (intracellular adhesion molecule) and EPCR (endothelial protein C receptor)
- Resulting in the erythrocytes resetting or clumping

### Treatment and prophylaxis for Malaria

#### Prophylaxis of malaria
- This is the use of antimalarial drugs to ‘prevent infection’
- Usually used by holiday makers
- You take the drugs for a period before you go (1-7 days)
- While you are away (Everyday or week)
- When you return (2-4 weeks)
- Has anyone taken prophylaxis for malaria?
- Does not stop you getting the infection but decreases the likelihood that an infection can develop
- It is not 100% effective
- You can still develop a serious infection
##### Quinine
- Alkaloid from bark of Cinchona tree
- Often use analogue quinidine (cardiac drug)
- Present in tonic water / IRN Bru
##### Chloroquine
- Synthetic derivative of quinine
- Drug of choice in non-resistant areas
- Mechanism - it blocks haem polymerase
- Prevents the formation of hemozoin
- Side effects - Prolongation of QT interval (cardiac dysrhythmia)
- Half life - 1-2 months (weekly dosing)
##### Doxycycline
- Antibiotic drug of choice for chlamydia
- Used chloroquine resistant areas
- Tetracycline antibiotic
- Mechanism - Not defined
- Possibly affects apicoplast genes
###### Side effects
- Heartburn
- Sunburn
- Milk and antacids affects its
###### absorption
- Half life - 18-22 hours (Daily dosing)
- Very cheap (20p / tablet)
##### Malarone
- Atovaquone + proguanil combination
###### Mechanism
- Proguanil inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite
- Blocks synthesis of purine (adenine / guanine > DNA)
- Atovaquone interferes with aerobic respiration
- Structurally similar to Ubiquinone (Co Enzyme Q) found in the mitochondria
- Inhibits Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) in the parasite
- Blocks synthesis of pyrimidines (Cytosine / thymidine)
##### Mefloquine (Larium)
- Used in chloroquine resistant areas
- Mechanism - Unknown
- Possibly the same a chloroquine
###### Side effects
- Linked to neuropsychiatric side-effects
- Anxiety
- Vivid dreams / nightmares
- Half life - 2-4 weeks (weekly dosing)
##### Primaquine
- Targets the Liver stage
- Hypnozoites
- P. vivax and P. ovale
- Mechanism - Unknown
- SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN in G6PD deficiency
	- Haemolytic anaemia

### Prevention
#### Personal protection
- Avoid breeding grounds of mosquitoes
- Ponds & stagnant water
- Cover up in evening and night
- When mosquito feeds
#### Repellents
- DEET (30%) or N,N,-diethyl meta-toluamide
#### Mosquito bed nets
Pros
- Prevent mosquitoes biting
- Impregnated with pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin) are insecticidal
- Reduced infant mortality by 30-60% in West Africa
Cons
- Require re-impregnation with insecticides
- Can easily become damaged, often difficult to repair
- Not always used for sleeping under
- Prevent natural immunity developing
#### Mosquito (vector) control
###### House spraying
- DDT
- Malathion
- Deltamethrin
###### Drainage of stagnant water
- Puddles
- Ditches
- Plant pots
- Removal of mosquito breeding grounds
#### Vaccines
- Development of the RTS,S Vaccine started in the 1980’s
- There are others but this is the only one that has made it to Phase 3 trials
- Usually with a vaccine you would use whole dead or live attenuated organisms
- With malaria this approach did not work

### Diagnosis
Symptoms depend on
- Travel history
- Where has the patient visited
- Or where does the patient live
- Is there drug resistance in the area
- Microscopy of blood
- Thick & thin films with Giemsa staining
#### Dipsticks
- Blood antigen detection of: Plasmodium histidine- rich protein (PfHRP2)
- Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)
- Used in the field
- Don’t require skilled personnel
#### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- Molecular technique
- Amplifies part of the 18S rRNA gene in Plasmodium

### Livers, Lurgies and Bloody mucous Lecture
#### Schistosomiasis
- Schistosomiasis is an acute and chronic parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma
	- Bilharzia
- Human infection is caused by
	- Schistosoma mansoni
	- Schistosoma japonicum
	- Schistosoma haematobium
	- Schistosoma intercalatum
	- Schistosoma mekongi (zoonotic)
- Inside the human host male and females copulate & live as a pair
	- S. mansoni & S. japonicum live in the veins around the digestive system
	- S. haematobium lives in the veins around the bladder
- Once egg production starts
	- Eggs then pass into bladder or intestine
- S. japonicum may live for 4 - 20 years
	- Producing up to 300 - 3000 eggs per day
	- Approx 22 million eggs from 1 worm pair
##### Epidemiology of Schistosomiasis
- The infection is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in poor communities without potable water and adequate sanitation
- 500 - 600 million people at risk from the disease
	- 240 million cases each year
	- 120 million are symptomatic
	- 20 million suffer severe consequences
- More UK tourists are becoming infected the rise in "off-track" tourism
##### Schistosoma geographical distribution
Intestinal schistosomiasis Schistosoma mansoni Africa, the Middle East, the
Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname

Schistosoma japonicum China, Indonesia, the Philippines

Schistosoma mekongi Several districts of Cambodia and the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic

Schistosoma guineensis and related S. intercalatum

Rain forest areas of central Africa
Urogenital schistosomiasis Schistosoma haematobium Africa, the Middle East, Corsica (France)

### Life cycle
![Pasted image 20260101152837.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101152837.png)

![Pasted image 20260101152916.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101152916.png)

### Pathology
#### Acute schistosomiasis infection
###### Swimmers itch (cercarial dermatitis)
- Is a transient symptom that occur within 12 hrs after cercariae penetrate the skin
- This is an IgE hypersensitivity (allergic)
- Macropapular pruritic rash
- Katayama Fever (or syndrome)
	- Occurs 6-8 weeks after initial infection Or many months
	- Before eggs are found in faeces
	- Schistosomulae are migrating
	- Fever, lethargy
	- Aches / pains
	- Cough
	- Severe itching
- Very rare in natives of endemic regions
	- Travellers / Tourists


### Urinary Schistosomiasis
- It is normally caused by Schistosoma haematobium
#### Bilharzia
##### Symptoms
- Rash, weakness, lethargy
- Blood in urine
- As the eggs crossing bladder epithelium this result in the body mounting an immune response
- Can result in bladder cancer

### Intestinal Schistosomiasis
#### Schistosoma mansoni & japonicum
- Cause of intestinal schistosomiasis
- Eggs are passed in faeces
- Liver pathology due to granuloma formation
##### Symptoms
- Rash, weakness, lethargy
- Diarrhoea
- Urticarial rashes
	- Portal hypertension
	- Portohepatic shunt
	- “Liver shunts”
	- Reopens foetal circulation
	- Umbilical hernia
	- Circulation bypasses the liver
- Colonic polyps
	- Common complication of S. mansoni in endemic areas
	- Often a result of ova being trapped in tissues leading to granuloma formation
		- These can haemorrhage leading to death
		- Biopsy can identify eggs in polyps
		- Enlarged liver and spleen
		- Hepatomegaly
		- Splenomegaly
		- Ascites (a-site-ees)
		- From greek word - baglike
		- Accumulation of fluid in the peritoneum


### Pathogenesis
- The eggs of S. mansoni do not remain localised in the blood vessels surrounding the intestines
- Ideally eggs find their way to the gut lumen
- Exploit immune system to migrate
- Defaecated out
	- Eggs that don’t penetrate into the intestines
		- Move towards the liver
			- S. mansoni primarily affects the liver
#### Worm pairs in the mesenteric vessels
- Some of the Schistosoma eggs are too big to traverse the liver sinusoids
- Equipped with Kupffer cells protect the liver
- Trapped eggs secrete soluble egg antigen (SEA)
- SEA is an immunogenic mixture of antigens
	- Alpha-1 / IPSE / smCKBP
	- Omega-1
- SEA proteins and the eggs elicit Inflammation
- Resulting in the recruitment of dendritic cells

### Granuloma formation
- The dendritic cell (DC) phagocytoses the SEA
- Enter vesicles within DC and complex with MHC proteins
- MHC proteins migrate to the outer surface of the DC presented to T cell
- This results in the activation of T cells
	- T cell response
	- B Cell response
- IL-2 secreted by the CD4+ T cells induces T cell proliferation
	- IL-2 also increases Th1 cell formation
	- Th1 cells secrete IFN-𝝲 which activates macrophages
- T cells produce IL-4 which induces T cell proliferation
	- IL-4 also drives the formation of Th2 cells
- Eggs are surrounded by a granuloma consisting of many cell types
- The Th2 response gives rise to antibody secreting plasma cells
	- Exact role of antibodies in granuloma is unknown
- IL-5 secreted by Th2 cells causes the recruitment of eosinophils
- IL-13 secreted by Th2 cells stimulates fibroblast activity
	- Resulting in deposition of collagen fibres & then hepatic fibrosis
- What does this mean for the liver and the Schistosoma egg?
- Ultimately the eggs (ova) die
	- Eventually the granuloma resolve
	- This leaves behind fibrotic plaques
	- Impaired liver perfusion (ischemia)
	- Increases portal vein pressure
	- Leading to portal vein fibrosis
	- Ascites and liver shunts
- The cost to the liver is massive
	- One female schistosome produces >million eggs in its lifetime
	- Each egg can potentially cause liver damage

### Treatment of Schistosomiasis
- The infection is treated with a single oral annual dose of Praziquantel
- Praziquantel is effective against all species of adult schistosome worms.
- Praziquantel is less effective against the juvenile, maturing worms
- Other drugs that can be used include:
	- Oxamniquine (Vansil)
	- Drontal (dogs and cats)
- Even with a cheap readily available drug the problem remains
#### Mechanism
- Drug induced muscle contraction of Schistosome
- Damage to tegument
- Vulnerable to antibody mediated damage

### Prevention of Schistosomiasis
- Praziquantel is donated by Merck through the WHO Praziquantel donation programme.
- Merck has pledged 250 million tablets for the treatment of schistosomiasis
- Infections can also be reduced
	- Removing the snail population (physical/chemical)
	- Removal of snail food source like water hyacinth
	- Vigorous towel drying after swimming
	- Improving sanitation (Provision of safe and clean water)

### Diagnosis of Schistosomiasis
#### Symptoms
- Urinary symptoms
- Intestinal / Liver symptoms
- Hepatomegaly / splenomegaly
#### Travel history
- Where has the patient visited
- Or where does the patient live
- Africa, South America, Asia?
#### Look for the eggs
- 150 μm in length
- Faeces (Keto katz - Wet prep microscopy, antigen test, PCR)
- intestinal polyps (Histology)
- Urine (Wet prep microscopy, antigen test, PCR)

### Gastrointestinal Tract Infections
- There are many different types
- Most food-associated infective diseases are bacterial but also viral and parasitical causes
- Most food-associated infections result from eating improperly treated animal products; includes meat, poultry, eggs, milk, fish, shellfish, and so on
- In developing countries GI infections are high due to poor sanitation and poor hygiene - spread feacal-oral
![Pasted image 20260101153604.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101153604.png)

#### The GI Tract

- Transmission:
- Pathogen ingested
- Food or water
- Contaminated hands or inanimate objects
- Foodborne infection
- Ingestion of pathogen in sufficient numbers

#### Pathogens Must Elude Host Defences
- Stomach acid pH < 4
- Kills >99.9% ingested Gram- negative enteric bacteria
- Intestinal motility
- Intestinal microflora
- Mucus
- Systemic and local immune
#### mechanisms
- Enzymes
- Others: (e.g. breast feeding)

#### Stages of Infection
- Ingestion
- 10 bacteria - Shigella dysenteriae

- Epithelial adherence
- E. coli sit on gut epithelium with no spread/invasion
- Epithelial invasion
- Trait of common causes of bacterial GI disease
- Produce endotoxins and/or Exotoxins
- Stays local or can spread
- Yersinia invade lymphatics → systemic infection

#### Conditions and Symptoms

- Direct person-to-person spread
- Indirect spread via food/water contaminated by human sewage Shigellosis (Bacillary dysentery)
- Diarrhoea with blood and mucus in stool
- Human pathogens - not found in animals
- Very low infective dose (10 organisms)
- Easily transmitted between people by contaminated food and water
- S. sonnei is mildest form → diarrhoea in UK
- Outbreaks in nurseries and schools
- S. dysenteriae → most severe (Shiga toxin)
- Acquired in countries with poor sanitation

![Pasted image 20260101153824.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101153824.png)

### EHEC aka STEC/VTEC
- Produce Shiga- or ‘vero’-toxin

- Can multiply at refrigerator temperatures
- Eating undercooked meat
- Enterocolitis, often with mesenteric adenitis
- Confused with appendicitis (children)
- Prolonged duration → immune-mediated complications e.g. arthritis
### Vibrio parahaemolyticus
- Halophilic (salt-loving) found in estuarine, marine and coastal environments
- Can contaminate seafood and fish
- Diarrhoea (milder than cholera) because of consuming undercooked seafood and fish

### Gastrointestinal Viruses
#### Norovirus
- Commonest cause of diarrhoea worldwide

- Survive well in the environment
- Can contaminate surface waters
- Cysts resistant to chlorine
- Treatment - metronidazole
- Prevention - good sanitation & clean water
- Cryptosporidium parvum - animal reservoir
- Unpleasant, self-limiting diarrhoea

- Giardia intestinalis - contaminated water, but also spreads person-to-person
- Diarrhoea can → malabsorption/weight loss
- Entamoeba histolytica - amoebic dysentery
- Severe diarrhoea, with blood and mucus

#### Isolation Media
- 1 gram of faeces contains 1011 bacteria
- 95% are obligate anaerobes
- rest are Enterobacteriaceae

### CULTURE
![Pasted image 20260101154109.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154109.png)

#### What Culture Plates/Tests?
- All specimens
- CCDA, Selenite enrichment broth, XLD agar
- If clinical details state
- Bloody diarrhoea → CT-SMAC agar
- Recent travel to known cholera area → TCBS agar
- Seafood consumption → TCBS
- Mesenteric adenitis/appendicitis → CIN agar
- Diarrhoea aged >65 → C. difficile test
- Travel to Africa, Asia, South America → parasite investigations
#### Campylobacter Identification
- Culture requirements differ to those of enterobacteria
- Microaerophilic
- O2, CO2 (>5%) for growth
- Thermophilic
- Growth at 42 ºC
- Slow growing (48 h)
- Gram stain morphology is diagnostic
- S-shaped Gram -ve rods
#### Isolation of Salmonella
- Inoculate amount of faeces into ‘selective/enrichment broth’ - Selenite cysteine or Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth
- Ideal conditions for bacterial multiplication
- After a few hours of incubation at 41 to 42oC subculture broth onto selective medium
- Malachite Green and Magnesium Chloride are included in the formulation as selective agents due to their ability to inhibit most enteric organisms but allow salmonellae to multiply freely
##### Identification of Salmonella spp. - XLD
- Red colonies with black centre
- Other ‘interfering’ organisms e.g. Proteus spp. resembling Salmonella spp. need ruling out
- Proteus spp urease +ve
- Salmonella spp urease -ve Salmonella spp. - Chromogenic Agar
- Salmonella spp. different colour to ‘interfering’ organisms
- When used for subculture of Selenite enrichment broths
- Reduces workload
- Suspected colonies identified by
- Serology
- MALDI-TOF/API 20E
#### Serogrouping Agglutination Test
- Antisera generated in animals to specific antigens on bacterial cell surface
- Different strains of bacteria have different antigens on surface
- Kauffmann-White scheme for salmonellae (>2000 serotypes)
- Polysaccharide ‘O’ antigen in cell wall
- Flagella ‘H’ antigen
- Capsular, virulence ‘Vi’ antigen (S. typhi)
- Combinations of different Antisera identified different serotypes/strains

#### NON-CULTURE TESTS:
- ELISA toxin tests
- molecular tests
- parasite concentration methods
- imaging-based methods
##### Clostridium difficile Toxin Detection by ELISA
- ELISA plate wells coated with antibodies to C. difficile toxins
- Add emulsified faecal specimen → 37 ºC/1h
- Add detecting antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
- If ‘toxin sandwich’ present → colour change
- Poor sensitivity
##### Molecular Detection Methods
- Cepheid GeneXpert cartridge to confirm positive C. difficile toxin EIA results
- Norovirus detection by reverse-transcriptase PCR
- Multiplex PCR panels containing targets for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens
- Increased sensitivity
- Shorter turnaround time to result

![Pasted image 20260101154206.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154206.png)

#### Fluorescence Microscopy
- Ova of Cryptosporidium parvum in a faecal smear stained with auramine phenol

#### Enteric Reference Laboratory…
- Confirms result obtained by the testing lab
- Provides a definitive identification where preliminary results are inconclusive
- Characterises an organism fully, including typing and whole genome sequencing which is unavailable at testing lab
- Performs tests that are either
- Too complex
- Infrequently performed by the testing lab
- Collects data to detect regional and national patterns of disease

### War wounds: Skin and soft tissue infections
Skin is a defence mechanism
- It is the largest organ of the body
- Primary and physical barrier against infection
- Mucosal membranes easier to breach
- Colonised by commensal organisms
- Normal flora
#### Structure of the skin
- The structure of the skin allows protection, insulation and flexibility
- Epidermis
- External layer
- Dermis
- Deep connective tissue layer
- Superficial fascia (subcutis)
- Loser connective tissue and fat
- Deep fascia
- Denser organised tissues - mucsle
#### Normal flora of the skin
- The microbiota of the skin is varied, dynamic and essential
- Often transient
- Can be removed by washing but soon return
- May colonise temporarily and then disappear
- Prevent colonisation by foreign organisms and opportunists
- Disrupted by hospitalisation and antibiotics
- This selects for more resistant organisms - S. aureus replaced by MRSA
The 2m2 of skin in the average body supports approx. 1012 bacterial cells.
These are either resident or transient and may also act as opportunists to cause 
disease.
The distribution of organisms is very dynamic but dependant and moisture availability - Dry G+ves and yeasts, Moist - G-ves and many others
Bacterial cells present underneath a human toenail
The normal flora is very varied and often lives in mixed communities that rely on each other for survival. This is particularly seen in the mouth.
#### Natural control of commensals
- A variety of mechanisms keep numbers under control
- Dry conditions - water availability is low in most places
- Acidic pH - <pH5.5
- High osmolarity - salty conditions inhibit most organisms except Staphylococci
- Surface temp. - 33oC is less than optimum
- Excreted substances - fatty acids, urea, AMP’s - defensins
- Competition between species
#### Predisposing factors to SSTI
- A variety of factors allow infection of the skin
- Perturbation of balance of commensal population
- Long term antibiotic treatment, long term increased moisture levels
- Breach of skin integrity - major and microscopic
- Burns
- Surgery / stabbing wounds, drug use, bites, sores, ulcers
- Long term Catheters
- Co-morbidities
![Pasted image 20260101154501.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154501.png)
![Pasted image 20260101154515.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154515.png)
#### Fungal infection in humans
- Superficial and cutaneous mycoses
- Caused by deposition of fungal material on surface of the body
- Skin, Hair, Nails
- Low virulence organisms (less pathogenic)
- Mostly remain confined to Keratinised epithelium
- Keratinophytes - degrade keratin
- Superficial and cutaneous mycoses
- Causative organisms are dermatophytes
- Three main genera - Microsporum, Trichophyton, Epidermophyton
- Skin to skin contact, fomites, pets, other animals
- Clinical manifestations referred to as ringworm or tinea
- Treatment with topical treatments

Azoles Tinea corporis dermatophyte infection of the body surface commonly called ring worm.
Tinea pedis dermatophyte infection of the skin between toes and on feet commonly called athlete's foot.

![Pasted image 20260101154553.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154553.png)
#### Staphylococcal skin infections
- Often result from breaks or infection of follicles
- Folliculitis
- Entry through hair follicle which become inflamed - Erythematous pustule forms around hair - long lasting damage to skin
- Boils (furuncles)
- Infection under the skin through infection of a gland or hair follicle.
- Carbuncles
- Larger than a furuncle - Deep subcutaneous abscesses with draining puss into the skin.
- Abscess formation can be a consequence of skin infection
- An accumulation of pus due to infection of a break in the skin - easy to diagnose and often in armpits anal regions - anaerobic organisms
- May be endogenous (from another site) or exogenous(another person) infections
- Treatment through drainage
A furuncle (boil) in the skin of the back. These start through infection of a single or collection of hair follicles.
An abscess in the gluteal region.
These start through infection of hair follicles or through other breaks in the skin.
![Pasted image 20260101154655.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154655.png)
![Pasted image 20260101154707.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154707.png)
#### Erysipelas
- Spreading Infection of dermis and subcutaneous tissues
- Swelling (oedema) and redness (erythema)
- Rash with a definite border containing small vesicles
- Skin orange peel like
- Butterfly- wing rash if on face
- May involve superficial lymphatics
- S. pyogenes
The characteristic butterfly-wing rash of Erysipelas
#### Cellulitis
- Spreading infection of deeper subcutaneous fatty tissues
- Begins as a superficial lesion - boils, insect bites - trauma leads to infection
- Lesion develops very quickly to give a rash with a spreading irregular border.
- Swelling, redness, tenderness/pain
- S. pyogenes & S. aureus
The spreading rash of cellulitis.
Often borders are marked to show the spreading nature
#### Treatment of spreading skin infections
- Treatment is dependant on organism and severity
- Approx. 5% of erysipelas cases develop bacteriaemia
- Cellulitis treatment based on clinical diagnosis
- Treatment essential as progression may be rapid
- Pathogen only isolated and identified in 25-35% of cases
- First line - Flucloxacillin, erythromycin, doxycycline
- Co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin, metronidazole if near eyes or nose Bacteraemia - a reminder
- The presence of bacteria in the blood
- Primary - bacteria enter the blood stream directly - no clear source of infection
- Dirty needle, catheters etc.
- Secondary - bacteria enter blood from another part of the body that is infected
- Wounds, lungs, intestine, genital mucosa

![Pasted image 20260101154734.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154734.png)

#### Necrotising Fasciitis
- Spreading infection of Subcutaneous fat and superficial fascia of muscle
- Rare and rapidly progressive potentially fatal
- Spreads along tissue plains efficiently due to lack of barriers in fascia
- May cause secondary necrosis
- Type I - mix of aerobes and anaerobes
- Type II - S. pyogenes
The coordinated action of degradative enzymes lead to the ‘flesh eating’ disease observed
#### Gas Gangrene
- Spreading infection of the deep muscles
- Uncommon but potentially fatal infection of severe trauma
- Gunshot wounds, surgery, blast injuries
- Wound colonised by Clostridium perfringens
- Spores germinate and produce alpha-toxin
- phospholipase C
- Necrosis induced and gas produced
- Rapidly progressive
Enzymatic decay promotes anaerobic environments and invasion. This leads to necrosis of tissue due to poor blood supply
The amputation kit was previously the only treatment for these infections. 
#### Treatment
- Necrotising Fasciitis
- Removal of all necrotic fascia - debridement
- High dose intravenous and local antibiotics
- Clindamycin / vancomycin
- Fluids / electrolytes
- Hyperbaric O2 therapy
- Prognosis poor
- Gas Gangrene
- Debridement of dead tissue required
- Prompt antibiotic treatment required
- Amputation may be necessary to prevent sepsis
- Prevention includes rapid cleansing of wounds

![Pasted image 20260101154816.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260101154816.png)
Diagnosis of infecting agents in wounds follows standard protocols, sampling and culture regimes.
Diagnosis and suseptibility testing is essential

#### Specimen collection
- The use of specialist sterile swabs is required
- Area of the wound is cleaned
- Suspected infected area swabbed
- Ames swabs are most used
- Different types depending on suspected organism
- Tube contains transport medium
- Good for wounds, abscess and pus 
Ames swabs are used for collection and transport. If available fresh draining puss or
tissue is better.

#### Sample processing
- Microscopy
- Useful for pus and tissue samples
- Less likely to be contaminated
- May help with treatment
- Early reporting of the presence of WBC’s and bacteria can help.
- Ideally only one organism should be present
- Wound swabs are contaminated with commensal organisms
Microscopy is a useful rapid reporting tool that can help direct
treatment

#### Why selective media is required
- Many sample areas are contaminated
- Wounds may be contaminated with faecal organisms if on lower body
- E. coli and Proteus
- Can mask colonies of other important organisms if on non-selective - S. aureus
- Environmental organisms present if blast or stabbing injuries
Manitol salt agar (MSA)is used to select for and differentiate different Staphylococci
A quick reminder about blood agar a complex/ differential media that grows most pathogens that contains defibrinated blood. Differentiates based on the ability to cause different levels of haemolysis

### ACDP III and IV pathogens: Working in containment
- A microbiologist is required to handle and identify a variety of pathogens  
- Mostly bacterial  
- opportunistic - S. aureus, P. aeruginosa.  
- Nosocomial - E.coli in urinary tract  
- Sexually transmitted (STD’S) - Neisseria gonorrheae  
- Occasionally unusual pathogens might occur  
- Bacterial and viral species  
- Might be foreign in origin - from travel abroad  
- Temperate, sub-tropical and tropical locations  
- May cause very serious life threatening infections in the patient  
- Easy to miss-diagnose - look like other infections  
- Can potentially cause serious infections in staff - often highly infectious

#### The HSE, ACDP and COSHH  
- Handling very dangerous pathogens takes special care  
- Techniques and equipment are the same for any organism of same type  
- Handling them safely is the hard bit  
- Government departments and legislation governs how work is carried out  
- Level and type of containment needed
- The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) - protect people from risks to safety arising from work based activities - Includes infection  
- Promoting training  
- Providing information  
- Actively researching areas of interest  
- Enforcement of legislation -  
- COSHH  
- Health and safety at work act etc 1974

#### The health and safety at work act (1974)  
- Enforced by the HSE  
- Basically puts responsibility for safety in the work place on everybody  
- ‘The Act sets out the general duties which employers have towards employees and members of the public, and employees have to themselves and to each other’.  
- Especially in the laboratory  
- Many regulations for the containment environment

##### COSHH  
- Control of Substances Hazardous to Health
- Substances include - reagents, solvents, medias, infectious organisms and anything with an exposure limit - section 3 COSHH  
- Regular assessments are needed to minimise risk.  
- Includes health surveillance  
- Training
- In section 3 a biological agent is defined as:  
- ‘any micro-organism, cell culture, prion or human endoparasite whether or not genetically modified which may cause infection, allergy, toxicity or otherwise create a hazard to human health’.  
- Only applies where work related - includes teaching and research  
- Other legislation and other government departments covers specific situations and pathogens - DEFRA

##### The ACDP  
- Advisory committee on Dangerous Pathogens
- Advise the HSE and Ministers for the Department of Health and the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural  
Affairs and their counterparts, on all aspects of hazards and risks to workers and others from exposure to pathogens.  
- Develop guidance of how organisms should be handled  
- Produce an approved list of pathogens

###### The ACDP Groups  
- Agents appearing in the Approved List are classified on the basis of their ability to cause disease by infection  
- Only agents in Groups 2, 3 and 4 are listed  
- Those not listed in these groups are not implicitly classified in group 1  
- The higher the group, the more infectious and pathogenic the organism is to humans  
- In allocating agents to a Hazard Group, no account is taken of particular effects of increased susceptibility
- ACDP Group 1  
	- Generally non pathogenic - Bacillus subtilis, laboratory strains of E. coli  
- ACDP Group 2  
	- May cause infections in humans but are normally treatable with  antibiotics or self limiting - P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Salmonella  enteritidis  
- ACDP Group 3  
	- Very infectious, Infection may to death if untreated - Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis. May be difficult to treat using conventional antibiotics.  May be transmissible.
- ACDP Group 4  
	- Highly infectious to humans and often transmissible.  
	- Highly pathogenic and often untreatable  
	- Infection often leads to death  
	- Mostly viral agents  
	- Ebola, Marburg, Machupo, Omsk, Rift valley fever virus

#### Containment of organisms  
- COSHH, ACDP, DEFRA, contained use regs (2014) set out minimum level and type of  containment needed for each pathogen  
- Part II and III of schedule 3 of COSHH - facility requirements  
- Hospitals - ACDP II mostly -ACDP III room  
- Use Level II were no real risk of culturing III or IV  
- Need access to Level III were suspected
##### Why are ACDP III and IV are so dangerous?  
- Many are zoonotic spp.  
- Removal from usual host to humans increases pathogenicity - host adaptation  
- Have numerous highly effective virulence factors - ability to cause disease in the healthy  
- Toxins, degradative enzymes capsules, injectable effector molecules, iron  scavenging molecules  
- Natural intrinsic resistance to antibiotics  
- Environmental species
- Intracellular mode of life or resistant to phagocytosis  
- Mediated through virulence factors - bacteria  
- Viruses obligate intracellular in a variety of cell types  
- Allows avoidance of immune response  
- Lack of effective treatments -  
- antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines  
- Often misidentified for another less pathogenic agents  
- Especially in clinical diagnosis

#### Discussion points  
- What do you do if you don’t know which category an agent goes in?  
- Why do you think the rules in schedule 3 of COSHH differ for labs, and industrial facilities?  
- What do you understand by the terms ‘Biological Agent’ and ‘Microorganism’?

#### Notifiable pathogens  
- UKHSA is responsible for studying the pattern of infectious disease in UK and investigation of uncommon outbreaks.  
- Key infections are continually monitored by microbiology labs in the UK and the PHE collates findings which are then published on their website:  
- Some infections are notifiable - doctors must report these  
- Some are ACDP group 3 or 4  
![Pasted image 20260104010624.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260104010624.png)
