## Selection
### What is it? And how does it “drive” evolutionary change?
#### Adaptation and Evolution 
processes of biological change over time
#####  EVOLUTION 
change in the distribution of traits/characteristics in a population from one generation to the next.
These traits/characteristics may be physical, physiological, or behavioural.

Macro-Evolution = Big Evolution
- Macroevolution is evolution on a large scale, occurring over long periods of time, that leads to major changes in life forms.
- More specifically, it refers to evolutionary processes that result in:
- the origin of new species (speciation)
- It’s usually non-reversable
- New species don’t “un-evolve”
- Before we can understand the process of Macro-evolution, we need to focus on a smaller part of it:
- Micro-evolution

Darwin’s idea was that there was likely many small changes over many generations that, over enough time, added up to a big enough change to create a new species!

Micro evolution = Small evolution
- Small-scale changes in a population over shorter periods of time
- Changes occur within a species
- Results in variation in traits (size, colour, resistance, etc.)
- On it’s own, we don’t think of micro- evolution as creating a “new species”
- However: Over long periods of time, many small microevolutionary changes can accumulate and result in macroevolutionary change (such as the formation of new species)

In Darwin’s eyes…
- Species change slowly over time through small modifications (microevolution).
- Given enough time, these small changes can accumulate, leading to the  formation of new species (macroevolution).
- If one original species changes in different directions in different environments, it can give rise to multiple new species (divergent evolution).

Micro-evolution is key to this…
- Macroevolution is often seen as the build-up of many microevolutionary changes over long periods of time.
- Large evolutionary changes are often seen because small-scale changes happen first.
- There are cases where the “small” changes aren’t all that small at all, but that’s for another lecture
- For now, to understand macroevolution, we will focus exclusively on microevolution for now.

##### A non-genetic take on evolution
EVOLUTION = change in the distribution of heritable traits/characteristics in a population from one generation to the next. These traits/characteristics may be physical or behavioural.

Remember, a lot of people were talking about/thinking about evolution before Darwin/Wallace
The reason why Darwin is so well known is that how came up with the answer to how: 
How can organisms change over time? How is that possible?
Darwin came up with a pretty good solution to this question:
Selection (Natural and Sexual Selection)

At the same time that Darwin was developing his
idea of natural selection,
Alfred Russel Wallace independently came up
with the same solution.
Both scientists are credited with explaining how
organisms change over time

Why is Darwin more famous?
- Darwin had been working on the idea for over
20 years.
- He gathered more extensive evidence and
examples.
- His book On the Origin of Species reached a
wide audience and had a big impact.
- Also, Wallace didn’t really ever agree with
sexual selection as an idea…

#### How do species change over time?
-Today, we recognize four forces of evolution that can cause populations to
change over time
![Pasted image 20260130131758.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260130131758.png)
Darwin + Wallce were
unfortunately dead
by the time these
things were
understood

A key historical point:
-What Darwin and Wallace figured out was selection
-Selection includes natural selection and sexual selection
-Selection is the primary driver of adaptation in populations
-While all four forces shape evolution, selection plays a central role and will
be the focus of the today and next week
-1858-1859 – Darwin and Wallace are presenting on/publishing their
ideas on selection
-Mutation as an idea only came to light in the early 1900s (Wallace was
alive for the start of these ideas)
-Genetic drift/Gene flow – 1920s-1930s

#### Natural Selection PROPOSED BY DARWIN (AND WALLACE)
BASED ON 4 FUNDAMENTAL OBSERVABLE FACTS (DARWIN’S FOUR POSTULATES):
1. [[#VARIATION]]
2. INHERITANCE (HEREDITY)
3. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTANCE
	3. Overproduction/Limited carrying capacity
	4. Differential (non-random) survival and reproduction
##### Variation 
Lots of variation for a given trait within a species/population
- Height
- Body shape
- Finger length relative to body size
- Hair color
- Skin tone
- Eye color
- Age at sexual maturity

#### Inheritance (Heredity)
- Variation passed from parents to offspring
- Generally speaking, relatives share more traits with one
another than do unrelated individuals
- Principles of inheritance (how inheritance works) were
not known when Darwin wrote Origin of Species
- Simply put, we share genetic information with our
family members
- That genetic information “codes” for our traits
- We will discuss genetics at a later time…
- for now, let’s ignore the genetic basis of traits, and
just focus on the traits themselves
- In short, we inherit our “traits” from out parents
- So to do all other organisms
- Remember, this will be both physical traits, and
also behavioural traits:
- Hight
- Growth speed
- Attraction to sweet foods
- Length of life before becoming reproductively
active
- Boldness
- Fur colour
- Average flower size
- Etc…

##### struggle for existence
###### Overproduction/Limited carrying capacity
- There are often more offspring born than can or do survive to
adulthood
- Limited resources
- Each generation experiences substantial mortality
- Not everyone survives long enough to produce babies, or,
some babies produce fewer babies because they die earlier

##### Differential (non-random) survival and reproduction
- From Darwin’s (and Wallace’s) perspective, variation that exists among
individuals results in some individuals fairing better than others!
- The individuals who survive are not random…
- The survivors tend to be the ones who inherited possess traits that make
better equipped to survive in their environment
- Individuals who happen to be born with traits
that help them survive get to grow up tend to
survive
- Traits that help you find food will increase your
likelihood of survival
- Traits that help you stay warm on cold nights will
increase your likelihood of survival
- Traits that help you avoid being eaten by predators
will help your likelihood of survival!
- Individuals with these traits (or other beneficial
traits) will live long enough to reproduce and
have kids…
- Individuals without these traits are more likely to
die…
 Individuals with beneficial traits live long enough to have babies
- Their babies will inherit the traits that kept their parents alive!
- Traits that helped the parents find food, stay warm, avoid predators, will be inherited by the offspring
- Individuals with less helpful traits tend to die…
- Do not pass on their less helpful traits
- Only the survivors of the competition for resources will reproduce
- The environment naturally selects some forms (variations) over others

#### Adaptation
- Here, the trait “long neck” was
selected for, because it gave
animals an advantage
- Long necks helped animals
access food and compete for
food they otherwise could not
- Over generations, individuals with
longer necks survived and
reproduced more successfully
- The trait “long neck” is now
referred to as an adaptation
- An adaptation is a heritable trait
that increases survival or
reproductive success in a
particular environment
- Adaptations arise due to
selection
- An adaptation is a heritable trait that increases
survival or reproductive success in a particular
environment
- When we say that an animal has an adaptation,
we mean that during the species’ evolutionary
history, this trait was once present in only some
individuals, not the entire population.
- Individuals that possessed the trait had higher
survival and/or reproductive success than those
that did not.
- Because these individuals produced more
offspring, the trait increased in frequency over
generations.
- Eventually, the trait became common within the
population, making it the norm

#### Peppered Moth (Biston betularia)
- A common moth found
throughout Britain and
Ireland
- You might find it in your
back garden!
- White with black
‘peppered’ pattern
- BUT – variation exists!
- Some moths are almost
entirely black (melanic form)
- Before the industrial
revolution, the light variant of
the moth was always more
common
- Look how well light moths
blends in with light bark on
trees, or light lichen on trees!
- Meanwhile, the dark melanic
form was less common:
- It stands out on light bark!
- The industrial revolution occurred
in Britain/Ireland in from 1760 to
about 1840 (approximately)
- During this time, industrialisation
and coal fires caused sooty air
pollution
- This blackened urban tree trunks
and walls, and killed off lichens
growing on trees.
- Look how well
DARK moths
blend in with dark
bark on trees!
- Meanwhile, the
LIGHT form stands
out!

##### Evolution by Natural Selection isn’t always slow!
- Moths have a fast life history
(they are born, and then
reproduce relatively quickly)
- The first black Peppered Moth
was recorded in Manchester
in 1848 and by 1895 (47 years),
98% of Peppered Moths in the
city were black.
- Interestingly, far away from
cities, the light moth was still
more common!
- In the 1900s, controls were
introduced to reduce air
pollution
- tree trunks became cleaner
and lichen growth increased.
- Sure enough, the normal pale
Peppered Moths were
camouflaged and the black
forms were more noticeable.
- As you would expect, natural
selection results in the normal
pale Peppered Moths being far
more common than the black
forms.

##### Peppered Moth illustrates
. Evolution (change) operates on a population:
- no individual moth ever changed color. Individuals do not “evolve”
2. Natural selection operates on the individual:
- Individuals survive and reproduce… or they don’t…
2. No such thing as an absolutely better variant – depends on the
environment
3. Variation had to be there in the first place

#### Selection for survival
- This process where nature “selects” who
survives is called natural selection
- If a trait has evolved because it helps an
individual, or that individual’s offspring
survive, it is attributed to natural selection
But not all selection is about survival…
It’s also about reproduction
- “Selection” incorporates two
components:
1) Natural selection
2) Sexual selection
- If a trait has evolved because it
helps an individual mate
(breed), it is attributed to sexual
selection

#### Survival & Reproduction
Survival & Reproduction
Survival alone is not the
important thing in
understanding evolution by
selection
Survival and then reproduction is
the key to understanding
adaptation, and evolutionary
change over time

#### Sexual Selection
- Babies only inherit their parents’
traits if the parent makes babies!
- Ie., survival isn’t enough – for traits
to get passed onto the next
generation, mating is essential!
Fitness = The ability to survive and reproduce
Fitness = Reproductive success
![Pasted image 20260130135851.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260130135851.png)

Sexual Selection - a mechanism proposed by Darwin to
explain secondary sexual characteristics (sexual dimorphism)
Darwin realised that some traits possessed
by (mostly) males were impossible to
explain with natural selection
- Traits didn’t seem to help with survival at
all
- Some traits even appeared to be
detrimental to survival!
- How could Darwin explain these traits?!
Darwin attributed the occurrence of secondary
sexual characteristics (traits that serve no survival
purpose or the mechanical process of
reproduction) to sexual selection

##### secondary sexual characteristics
-Male-Female distinctions that appear at puberty
– Distinctions between adult males and females that go
beyond basic reproductive differences
– Differences in size, coloration, weaponry, shape,
ornamentation, behaviour
– The presence of secondary sexual characteristics in a
species creates sexual dimorphism

#### Sexual Dimorphism
##### humans
Men and women (adult humans) differ in:
- Hight
- body build
- craniofacial structure
- voice pitch
- Body hair
- Facial hair

Please note:
- Like hight, there is a RANGE of these traits…
- There are TALLER women, and SHORTER men
- Some men don’t grow much facial hair, and some women
do!
- Some men develop less muscle mass at puberty, while some
females develop a lot!
- Still: there are general trends that separate adult male and
adult female humans
These are secondary sexual characteristics

#### Terminology Necessity
Darwin needed a second mechanism to explain these  because secondary sexual
characteristics are NOT easily explained by Natural Selection
Are often not beneficial to survival
Are often not beneficial to survival
Are sometimes detrimental to survival
Only appear after puberty…

![Pasted image 20260130140902.png](/img/user/images/Pasted%20image%2020260130140902.png)

##### intrasexual selection
Most often = Male – Male competition
Intra = on the inside; within
Members of one sex [usually males] try to
successfully out compete members of their
own sex in a process of intrasexual
competition
Secondary sexual characteristics give males
a reproductive advantage (a fitness
advantage) through competition with other
males.

Examples: 
- weaponry!
- Can be vocalizations
- Can be plumage
- Can be non-weapon based aggression

###### Male weaponry
We expect that direct male-
male competition should lead
to the appearance of:
- Traits associated with
winning direct battles
- Traits for advertising a
male’s competitive ability
(to other, rival males)

###### Fighting
- Example: In many species of ungulate
(deer, bovines), males grow antlers or
horns
- These traits do NOT help them survive
longer!
- Instead, they are used to help males
fight among each other
- Males in these species often mate
guard
- One male monopolizes access to
females
- Only these males can mate
- These males have evolved
horns/antlers to fight off other males
who try to depose them
###### signalers
- Some of these traits might just reveal
something honest about the signaler
- The Classic example is “expensive” signals
- The “Handicap principle”
- Signals that are energetically costly, or
increase the signaler’s risk of death tell us
something:
- They tell us that the signaler is healthy/strong
enough to maintain the signal, AND be a
healthy, functional individual
- Peacock analogy
- Body size (think sexually dimorphic species)
- Some colors likely harder to maintain

###### Vocalisation
Source Filter Theory
Vocal sounds are produced by
The Source:
1. Passing air from the lungs, towards
the vocal chords
2. Air causes vocal chords vibrate -
create sound consisting of many
frequencies
The Filter:
3. Frequencies are filtered
(attenuated or enhanced) as
sound travels through the
pharynx, nasal cavity, oral cavity,
past the tongue and lips
4. Final sound released from mouth

Variation in vocal production system
results in variations in a signal’s
acoustic structure

Some species have developed anatomic specializations for
long-distance calls – An additional portion of the “filter”

##### intersexual selection
###### Female choice
Darwin hypothesized that some
traits (mostly found in males)
evolved not for the survival
advantages they provided
their wearers, but because
females preferred them
Secondary sexual characteristics
can also give males a
reproductive advantage by
making them more attractive
to females.

Some sexually selected traits
that likely evolved via
Female Choice:
- Behavioural and/or
acoustic courtship displays
- Ornaments
- Pelage/plumage
- Skin colouration

###### Fighting across sexes
- For example. In many bird species, males
have evolved ornate, decorative plumage
- This plumage does NOT help them
camouflage, and it does not help them fly
- It does NOT help them survive
- Instead, it seems to “catch the eye” of the
opposite sex
- In this case, males likely evolved these traits
as they increase the likelihood that a
female will be interested in mating with the
male
- Often, this plumage can be mixed in with
flashy “sexy” displays that are also eye
catching!

###### Handicap Principle
Indian peafowl:
Harikrishnan et al. (2010) – a paper about this if you’re interested!
- Long tail requires energy to maintain
- Therefore, the long train (the long tail) is
an indicator of good body condition
- If the peacock was in poor condition,
it COULDN’T maintain/grow such an
elaborate tail
- If you’re a male, trying to show a female
that you’re a good mate, then these
energetically expensive traits are a great
thing to have!

###### Sexy Son Hypothesis
Desireable Traits Will Be Passed On Which Increases Fitness

### A deeper dive: Selection pressure, Costs, Benefits, Trade-offs, and Patterns

#### Selection (Natural and Sexual) at work
- Darwin saw natural selection as an unguided process
	- No planner, no intention… populations change because some variants leave more offspring than others.
- Think of the traits possessed by a population of organisms as being set by a fader on a mixing desk
- Natural selection is a hand that moves the faders generation by generation making the population more “optimized” for it’s environment

Different traits in a population could be through of as “faders” that take on different values in different individuals For Example:
- Body 
- size boldness
- Arm length
- Hairyness
- Brain size
- Life span
- Size of scales
- Beak size
- Litter size
- Finger length 
- Claw size

These traits are SET in a given organism…
Individuals within a population have SLIGHT variations in the levels of these faders (different values for these traits) 
Individuals whose values are “better suited” to the environment make more babies than those whose trait values are less suited to the environment
Those individuals pass on their settings at a high rate to the next generation 
The next generation inherit those settings, and are therefore adapted to that
environment

The “average value” of these faders within the population can shift generation
to generation due to Selection
- The “invisible hand” moving “faders” is a nice metaphor, but modern evolutionary biologists have specific terms for these “hands”
- Selection pressure (selective force)
- Fitness benefits (sometimes just called benefits)
- Fitness costs(sometimes just called costs)
We call this “selection pressure”
This selective force usually comes in the form of either a fitness cost or a fitness benefit 

Evolutionary biologists are interested in working out the selection pressure that
led to a trait evolving
For Example: What is it that is it that selects for A size increase?
There are a lot of possible selective pressures that could lead to a species
growing over time!

Perhaps this population lives in an environment with lots of small predators…
- If those small predators are better at catching smaller birds, then that would decrease the number of small birds that live to reproduce
- The selective pressure leading to increased body size here is predation

##### Predation -> selective pressure -> body size
- There are many documented cases where evolutionary biologists hypothesize that a population’s average body size is “shaped by” predation predator
- Geographic Variation: Noticed that guppy populations differ in morphology across their range.
- Size Differences: Specifically, it was already noticed that mature individuals were larger in some localities than others


###### Predation, and Selection for Body size in prey animals
- Selection for Larger Body Size in Guppies
- At sites with Larger guppies, the most common predatory fish in the water is Rivulus hartii (Killifish)
- Simply put, conditions at these sites were most amenable (predator wise) to the killifish
- Predator preference: Killifish mainly consumes small, immature guppies (<13 mm)
In water bodies with lots of Killifish:
The Killifish tends to eat small prey
This creates a selection pressure, that over many generations pushes the guppie
population to grow quickly (go from small to big FAST), and to grow larger overall


Selection pressure: The abundance of the predator Rivulus hartii (Killifish) creates a selection pressure for the guppies to evolve faster growth, and larger adult body size!

Selection for Larger Body Size in Guppies
- Adaptive (evolutionary) response: 
	- Guppies evolve to outgrow the vulnerable size quickly – they grow FAST – they get bigger than 13mm before they are even sexually mature, and continue to grow from there!
- Outcome: Grow fast, and achieve a larger size; adults typically >16 mm
- Adaptation 
	- The population has adapted to the abundance of killifish by evolving to be larger on average
- Evolution!!!

Selection for Smaller Body Size
- At sites with smaller guppies, the most common predatory fish in the water was Crenicichla alta (Pike cichlid)
- In terms of predators, conditions at these sites were most amenable to the Pike cichlid
- Predator preference: Crenicichla is a piscivore (a specialized fish predator) that targets large, mature guppies

In water bodies with lots of Pike Cichlid:
The Pike Cichlid tends to eat LARGER prey
This creates a selection pressure, that over many generations pushes the guppie population to grow slowly, and stay small
Adult body size of original population
Selection pressure: The abundance of the predator Crenicichla alta (Pike cichlid) ) creates a selection pressure for the guppies to evolve
Smaller body size on average, because Pike cichlids will typicaly ignore smaller
fish

Selection for Smaller Body Size
- Adaptive response: 
	- Selection favours maturity at smaller sizes – Guppies grow slowly, and hit maturity early (at a small size)
- Outcome
	- Guppies are significantly smaller as adults – they are less appealing to the Pike cichlid
- Adaptation 
	- The population has adapted to the abundance of Pike cichlid by evolving to be smaller on average
- Evolution!!!
#### Selection pressure -> Costs vs Benefits
- When considering selection pressures, you can usually frame that “pressure” in terms of costs and benefits
- Benefit: When a trait has the effect of increasing an organism’s fitness
- Ie., the trait helps the organism survive, reproduce, or both
- Cost: When a trait has the effect of decreasing an organism’s fitness
- Ie., the trait decreases survival probability/life expectancy, or decreases an organism’s likelihood of finding a mate, or successfully rearing offspring
- Remember – at the end of the day, the term fitness really equates to reproductive success
- High fitness = Contributed more babies to the next generation
- Low fitness = Contributed relatively few babies to the next gen.
- Natural and Sexual selection should work to get rid of costly traits
- Ie., there will be selection pressure against costly traits
- Natural and Sexual selection should make beneficial traits more common
- Ie., there will be selection pressure for beneficial traits 

In water bodies with lots of Killifish:
The Killifish tends to eat smaller prey
This creates a selection pressure, that, over many generations, “pushes” the
guppie population to grow quickly, and grow larger

There is a cost to being too small
There is a benefit to growing larger
The interaction of costs and benefits create the selection pressure

In water bodies with lots of Pike Cichlid:
The Pike Cichlid tends to eat LARGER prey
This creates a selection pressure, that over many generations pushes the guppie population to grow slowly, and stay small


There is a cost to being too large
There is a benefit to staying small
The interaction of costs and benefits create the selection pressure

Selection for size is 100% contingent on the environment:
In this case, the predators in the environment
In one habitat, there was selective pressure that pushed guppies to evolve to be smaller on average
In a different habitat, there was a different selective pressure that pushed guppies to evolve to be larger on average

In both these cases, we have seen a clear direction in terms of how selection affects a trait
We call this [[#Directional selection]], because individuals at one extreme of the trait distribution have higher fitness than others.
#### Patterns of natural selection
##### Three categories of selection
1. [[#Directional selection]]
2. Stabilizing Selection
3. Disruptive Selection
###### Directional selection
-  individuals at one extreme of the trait distribution have higher fitness than others.
- As a result, the population mean shifts over generations toward that favoured direction
- While variation around the trait may decrease or remain similar.
We’ve already looked at a few examples of directional selection
- [[#Peppered moth]]
- Darwin’s Finches (Grant’s research)
- If we started with 50/50 population of white/black moths…
- There was directional selection for moths to be white, because lichen covered tree bark is light
- Selection pressure:
	- predation
- But during the industrial revolution, bark becomes darker (lichen dies), and the direction of selection changed…
- Now the darker morph is better camouflaged
- We still have directional selection, but in the opposite direction!
- Selection pressure is still predation

##### The Grant’s work Finch beak depth
- The drought discussed in the paper we read last week
- This killed all the easy to get to foods, leaving only hard to get foods
- Having only hard to access foods created a strong directional selection pressure
- There was a clear cost to animals with small beaks
- There was a clear benefit to birds with deeper beaks
- Directional selection pushed beaks in the population towards a deeper depth
- Directional selection pushed the population to a larger body size

So, let’s say this population of birds is slowly evolving to be larger because there is a predator in the area that is good at catching smaller individuals, but less good at catching larger ones

Small woodland raptor
(e.g. Eurasian sparrowhawk–type predator)
An abundance of small raptors in our habitat acts as a selective pressure pushing up
the mean size of the small coal tit over many generations
- 6-8 grams
- 7-9 grams
- 8-10 grams

Will this “directional push” go forever?
If we move forward in time to the year 4000, will coal tits still be getting larger
and larger?!
It’s possible – think about ostrich, or the now extinct elephant bird! Some birds
have evolved to be HUGE but, it’s often the case that traits will stabilize over an organism’s evolution…
Think of it this way – why don’t all prey species just evolve to be HUGE?

Will this push go forever?
Going back to costs vs benefits analysis, there are usually more than one selective pressure operating on any given trait at one time
In the case of body size, while predation pushes sizes upwards, can you think of another force that could push the other way at the same time?
Predation pushing sizes larger ?

What other selective forces (selective pressures) could keep our prey species from becoming HUGE, despite the fact that the smallest birds have lower fitness?
Ideas?
Predation pushing sizes larger ?
##### Why Selection Can Favor Staying Small (Despite Predation)
- There are lots of possible selective pressures that will keep our birds on the smallish size, despite predation:
	- Energetic costs
	- Physical constraints of the environment (getting around gets harder)
	- Loss of agility
	- At large enough sizes, loss of flight
	- Etc…
- One example: Energy costs
	- Energetic constraints can impose strong costs on larger body size.
	- Larger individuals require more food to maintain metabolism, growth, and reproduction.
- Increased starvation risk (size- selective starvation)
	- When resources are limited, large individuals experience higher likelihood of starvation due to insufficient energy intake.
- Competition limits achievable size
	- In many natural environments, food availability and competition with members of your own species prevent populations from supporting very large individuals.
- Net effect: constrained growth

These energetic costs balance or override selection for larger size, favouring smaller or intermediate body sizes.

This small raptorial bird is putting a selection pressure on our coal tit population
There is a cost to being small: you are more likely to be eaten by the small raptor
Over time, our population should become larger on average

Adult body size of original population
Predation pushing sizes larger

But, at the same time, competition over access to food may be strong enough that larger individual starve
They simply cannot find enough food to sustain themselves
The benefit of being smaller is that it’s easier to find enough food to sustain yourself

Adult body size of original population
Predation pushing sizes larger
Larger birds are more likely to starve in this environment
Food availability and risk of starvation pushing sizes smaller
Depending on the environment, the relative costs/benefits of these two opposing forces will change
In a habitat with fewer small raptors, there is less of a cost on being small
We would expect over evolutionary time for our coal tits to evolve smaller bodies on average, because the costs of smaller body size are relaxed

Adult body size of original population
Less pressure here
Larger birds are more likely to starve in this environment
Food availability and risk of starvation pushing sizes smaller
Adult body size of original population
Larger birds are more likely to starve in this environment
Still pressure, but less
Predation pushing sizes larger
In an environment rich in food, there is less risk of starving (still some, but
the risk is not as intence)
Here, we might expect slightly larger birds as the cost of large body size is relaxed
This process is called [[#Stabilizing selection]]
##### Stabilizing selection

- In stabilizing selection, there are at least two selective pressures acting on a trait in opposite directions.
- This results in a trait honing on at a specific “range” over several generations
- A type of natural selection that favours some “intermediate” trait values, selecting against extremes.
- It tends to reduce variation in a population over time.

###### Food choice behaviours in shore crabs
- Shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) eat bivalve muscles (a type of mollusc)
- These molluscs come in many different sizes

There are benefits to eating the larger shellfish
- Said plainly, larger shellfish have more meat/nutrients in them
- If a crab wants to gain energy (the entire purpose of eating), it should choose to spend time looking for larger muscles

There are also costs to eating large shellfish
- All bivalves (shellfish) have at least one adductor muscle
- Thes are extremely powerful muscles that they use to pull their two valves (the two halves of their shell) shut!
- Sure enough, larger oysters have stronger Adductor muscles, and are harder to open!
- The cost of choosing larger shellfish to eat is that the crab has to burn a lot of energy just to open its meal! 
	- It’s hard work!
- Remember, the purpose of eating is to GAIN energy, not to burn it!
- The costs and benefits are reversed for crabs who eat small shellfish…
- Benefit: Small shellfish have small adductor muscles, making them easy to access (you don’t burn lots of energy to gain access to the meat on the inside)
- Cost: there is way less meat on the inside! You have to eat many many small shellfish to get anything out of it, and that requires crabs to spend more time and energy looking for more food!
###### “happy medium”
For a crab, maybe the optimum strategy is to choose shellfish that are “in the
middle”
- Avoid overly larger molluscs, because the energy you spend trying to open them makes them “not worth it”
- Avoid oysters that are too small, because although they are easy to eat, you waste too much energy trying to findenough of them to get a full meal!
- The best strategy (the optimum strategy) might be to eat medium sized shellfish
- This middle ground is where the benefits aremaximized, and/or th costs are lowest making it the best strategy!
- We might say that this strategy maximizes fitness 
- Sure enough, when researchers watch these crabs, the crabs tend to favour “middle sized” oysters, and avoid overly small, or overly large ones
- This behaviour is maximizing fitness

Sexual selection Often shows patterns in line with stabilizing selection
- Last week, I mentioned the handicap principal
- Due to sexual selection, and animal (usually males) will evolve a trait that is energetically expensive
- Females evolve to be attracted to that trait
- Males who have the trait must be in good shape, because that trait is costly
- Females who mate with males with costly traits will have high-quality, healthy babies

Female Choice puts selection pressure towards larger tails
Males with short tails don’t have many babies – Females have evolved
to be choosy
They only mate with males with decently long tails!
But by definition, there is a cost – if your tail is too long, you simply cannot support it!
It get’s in the way, and attracts predators (easy meal)
Big tailed males are easily picked off by predators
This creates “stabilizing selection” for a long, but not too long tail

#### Disruptive selection
When selection has two or more “best answers”
- A type of selection that favours two or more different trait values at different parts of the spectrum in the same population
- There is selection against intermediate traits
- This can lead to populations with two different “types” o individuals.
Selection is pushing against the middle value, favouring both lower values, and higher values simultaneously!

In some cases, costs and benefits work in such a way that there is more than one “optimum” value for a trait
For example, what if being small has certain benefits…
But at the same time, maybe being large has certain benefits…
Meanwhile, being “in between” size is costly…
Perhaps our larger birds, as before, are less likely to be eaten by our small raptorial predator – as before, they are simply too big for a small bird of prey to eat
There is a clear benefit to being large

Benefit to being large
Perhaps our larger birds, as before, are less likely to be eaten by our small raptorial predator – as before, they are simply too big
There is a clear benefit to being large REALLY small birds are fast, and manuverable
Although the small hawk can eat them, they are REALLY hard to catch because they are fast, and great flyers!
There is a benefit to being extra small
Benefit to being large
Benefit to being small

Middle sized birds have 2 costs
1) They are small enough that they can still be eaten by the small hawk
2) They are slower than the smallest birds – it’s easier for the hawk to catch them, so the get picked off at a high rate

We expect two morphs to evolve: smaller birds and larger birds.
- Large birds benefit from reduced predation because small predators cannot effectively attack them
- Small birds benefit from high speed and agility, making them difficult for predators to catch

Middle-sized birds experience neither advantage.
- They are small enough to be vulnerable to predators, but not agile enough to escape efficiently.
As a result:
Middle-sized birds are selected against and become rare.
Conclusion:
There are two successful strategies in this population, illustrating disruptive selection.

###### What do we mean by a “strategy” in evolution?
- A strategy is a trait (or a set of traits) that affects an organism’s fitness (survival and reproduction)
- It is not a conscious choice made by individuals
- Strategies arise through natural/sexual selection acting on heritable variation
- In this example:
	- Large-body strategy: avoid predation by being too big to eat
	- Small-body strategy: avoid predation through speed and agility
- What makes a strategy successful:
	- Individuals using these strategies may survive longer
	- Individuals using these strategies may breed more
	- They leave more offspring
	- Their traits become more common in the population over generations

##### Disruptive selection in action
Personality traits in the dumpling squid
(Euprymna tasmanica)
Yes, natural selection has shaped our personalities too!
Behaviour that aids in survival
- Dumpling squid, Euprymna tasmanica
- Experimenters have identified two behavioural responses to threats in lab:
- Shy: squids that are “shy” will swim away from anything
- Scientists would lightly pass hand near squid
- Shy squids instantly run away (swim away) from anything in their vicinity
- Bold: squids that are “bold” don’t run away so easily
- They tolerate light agitation
- You would really have to poke at them to disturb them enough to “hide” from you
- Squids seemed to do either our… you’re either a “shy” squid, or a “bold” squid
	- This personality trait is heritable!
- Squid were allowed to reproduce in lab
- Sure enough, parents who were bold tended to have bold offspring
- parents who were shy tended to have shy offspring
- Note: This is not learnt – Squids don’t parent the way we do
- So – Shyness/boldness is heritable! Is behaviour learned, or is it inherited?
	- A tough question often times…

Behaviour that aids in survival
- These different behaviours relate to antipredator behaviour:
- A shy squid is skittish, and would swim away from/hide from any other animal it perceives in the water near it, thus keeping it safe from predators
- A bold squid waits until it has really clear evidence there is a predator nearby – it will swim away, but only if it’s more “confident” there is danger

Shy vs Bold: two “Strategies”
- We can considerer these to be two different antipredator strategies
- We expect that behavioural strategies like these have evolved to maximize the animals’ fitness (survival and reproductive success).
- Within a given species/population, there can be more than one strategy for a given situation
- This is the case here…

Remember that in evolutionary biology, strategies are not conscious decisions:
- The “shy” strategy is just something the shy squid “do”… they don’t think to themselves: “okey, my strategy is to run away if anyone comes near”
- Think of it instead as an automatic thing…
- They are just “skittish”
- In the same way, “bold” squid are simply less skittish…
- Let’s start with a population where 50% of the squid have the “shy” strategy, and the other 50% have the “bold” strategy
Half the population hide when they sense something nearby

SHY
Half the population are less “shy”… they don’t immediately hide when they sense something nearby

BOLD
Population is evolving! In our new generation, most are “shy”: they hide when something is sensed nearby
Evolution!
Here, we see the evolution of behaviour/personality!
The environment (which had predators) selected for squid that were more “shy”
Predators put a clear selection pressure towards the “shy phenotype
Being shy had a fitness benefit
Being “bold” had a fitness cost
Over enough time, you might even expect the “bold” condition to disappear!
Evolution!
Hey!
Wake up!
Review question:
Is this micro-evolution?
Or
Is this macro-evolution?
Evolution!
Remember, this is micro-evolution
We are still working with the same species: the dumpling squid
All that’s happened here is that over 3 generations, this population has adapted (through natural selection)
This population has evolved to be more shy (skittish) as an adaptation to predation!
- This is directional selection
	- there is a clear benefit to being “shy”, and a huge cost (death) to being bold
	- The population moves in one direction, towards a “shy-er” state.

Costs vs Benefits
Shy vs Bold squid
- Benefit of being shy:
- You are more likely to escape a predator early, meaning some other individual will be eaten instead of you
- This increases your life expectancy, giving you more opportunity to reproduce!
- Cost of being bold:
- You are among the last to swim away when a predator is nearby
- This makes you likely to be eaten
- You are likely to die before you ever reproduce, soyou are unlikely to pass on your “boldness” to any offspring

Costs and Benefits – the trade off
- Usually, it’s not that simple
- Most traits possessed by animals today have benefits and costs
Costs and Benefits:
But sometimes, there isn’t a single best strategy….
- In our simplified example, the “shy” strategy was clearly the better option.
- If this were true though, why are there still “bold” squid? In the real world?
- Why do bold squid still exist if being shy is so much better?
- Should natural selection not have gotten rid of all them yet?
There are many fish in the sea…
- Some fish may be dangerous…
There are many fish in the sea
- But by far, most of the fish in this image would not be a threat to our friend the squid!
- Let’s imagine that everything in this image is “squid friendly” except for the shark…
More often than not, when our squids detect something moving nearby, it will NOT be a dangerous predator…
It’s more likely to be some harmless fish
Despite there being no real danger, the “shy” squid are going to panic, and swim away…
Meanwhile, the “bold” squid stay put, and are not bothered…
Class question:
With this in mind, can you image a cost to being “shy”?
The costs of being shy…
- “Shy” squids waste a LOT of time and energy!
- It you are constantly swimming away every time another, non-dangerous fish swims by, you are burning a lot of energy!
- Survival and reproduction takes energy, so you don’t want to waste it!
- While you are swimming away, you loose the opportunity to find food, or mates
- Again, being shy has costs to it!
The benefits of being bold
- As a “bold” squid, you DON’T waste time or energy running from things that can’t hurt you!
- You have extra time to eat and reproduce
As we said before, the “bold” squid get eaten more often than shy squid,
because they don’t swim away/hide when they detect other animals nearby…
However, there are so many “harmless” fish in the sea…
It’s likely that “shy” squid burn a lot of energy needlessly trying to hide from them because they are so shy!
Also, every time they hide like this, they are loosing the opportunity to find food themselves…
With this in mind, “shy” squid probably die younger on average than the bold squid who don’t get eaten…
They simply don’t get as much time to feed!
Additionally, finding and attracting mates takes time and energy
Producing babies (eggs in the case of squid) also takes energy
The energy that bold squid “save” by not running away all the time may increase the number of babies a “bold” individual can produce!
In the end, both strategies - “Bold” and “Shy” - have both Costs, and Benefits
CostsBenefitsBehavioural strategy
By constantly running and hiding, you are constantly burning energy, and missing out of feeding time, and reproductive opportunities. This decreases the fitness of the shy individuals
By running and hiding, these squid are less likely to get eaten, increasing their fitness from a survival (and eventual reproduction) perspective
Shy
When something dangerous comes around, you are way more likely to get eaten
You don’t waste time running and hiding every time is small fish swims by. This gives you all the opportunity you need to find food, eat it, and find mates, and invest energy into reproduction
Bold
Because both strategies have costs and benefits, both may be maintained in the population!
Here, we started with a 50/50 breakdown of “shy” vs “bold” squid…
We have maintained this same distribution, because both strategies have their own benefits and costs. In this case, neither is a “better” strategy!
Remember: Darwin (and Wallace) said the environment (physical/social) is what selects for traits
S0: Think about the environment selection takes place in!
- Remember,: we expect that the intensity of the benefits and costs of different strategies to be dependant on the environment
- In some environments, the benefits of being shy increase And/or
- We expect the costs of being shy to decrease
- In other environments, the benefits of being bold increase And/or
- We expect the costs of being shy to increase
- So: We expect the proportion of “shy” vs “bold” to vary with the environment
- Remember – it is the environment that selects for traits in selection!
The optimum strategy for any behaviour will depend on the environment!
Environment with LOTS of predators:
Being eaten is a constant risk!
Environment with very few or no predators:
Being eaten is very unlikely
Environment with intermediate number of predators
All the “bold” squid get eaten!
Natural selection creates a population of “shy” squid
Bold squid are not eaten, and benefit from saving energy that shy squid are wasting. Eventually, being bold becomes the most common strategy
Some intermediate proportion of bold to shy squid remain in population, as both strategies have their costs and benefits
Environment with intermediate number of predators
Some intermediate proportion of bold to shy squid remain in population, as both strategies have their costs and benefits
In some environments, the interaction of costs and benefits allows more than one viable strategy.
This can lead to disruptive selection.
In our example, both the “shy” and “bold” squid strategies are viable, but for different reasons.
Each strategy balances costs and benefits in a different way, illustrating an evolutionary trade-off.
An evolutionary trade-off is a term worth discussing…
Evolutionary trade-off:
- An evolutionary trade-off occurs when a benefit in one context comes at a cost in another.
- Trade-offs exist because organisms can’t maximize everything at once.
Invest in reproduction?Invest in Survival?
Why do trade-offs exist?
- Resources are limited (energy, time, materials).
- Investing in one function reduces the resources we have to invest in others.
- Darwin (and Wallace) recognized that resources are finite.
- Within an organism, energy must be divided among:
- avoiding predators
- growing
- finding mates
- reproducing
- moving, signalling, social behaviour, etc.
- There simply isn’t enough energy to do all of these maximally.
- So organisms prioritize—and that prioritization creates trade-offs.

Trade-offs in our squids:
Shy squid
- Benefit: Lower risk of being eaten
- Cost: High energy use → less time/energy for reproduction
Bold squid
- Benefit: Saves energy → more growth and reproduction
- Cost: Higher risk of being eaten
- Here, the trade off is between predator avoidance, or saving energy for other things
Environment with intermediate number of predators
Some intermediate proportion of bold to shy squid remain in population, as both strategies have their costs and benefits
When we talked about costs and benefits, we were already talking about trade-offs
- These squid face a trade-off between avoiding predation and reproduction/finding food.
Shy Bold
Really good at avoiding getting eaten
Really good hunting, finding mates

Some form of intermediate (if possible)
Here, the “shy” squid strategy “trades-off” immediate reproductive success (spending time finding mates) for survival
The “bold” squid strategy does the opposite… This strategy emphasises finding mates over avoiding predators
When we talked about costs and benefits, we were already talking about trade-offs
Small tail Long tail
Really good at moving around, avoiding getting eaten – no females are interested
Really sexy: all females want to have his babies – but can hardly walk case of stabilizing selection, intermediate phenotypes are favoured.
Selection favours a compromise between the two sides of a trade-off, rather than extremes.

Here, it appears the extreme values are simply too extreme
The best trade off is something in the middle
Still, within the middle, there is still room for small shifts wither way

Looking at traits across species
- Up to now, we’ve focused on variation in traits within species.
- A useful way to think about different reproductive strategies, their costs, benefits, and trade-offs, is to look at variation in traits between species.
- We could explore any trait this way, but today, today, let’s focus on how species differ in producing and caring for their young.
African Elephant – Loxodonta africana
- Gestation: ~22 months (one of the longest of any land mammal)
- Offspring per birth: usually 1 calf at a time
- Breeding interval: typically 4–5 years between births
- Parental care: prolonged; calves are cared for by their mother and herd for several years
- Lifetime reproductive output: relatively low; often only a few calves per individual
- Survival from birth to reproductive age is roughly 50–60% in wild populations
Fruit flies – Drosophila spp.
- Life cycle: short from egg to adult – as little as ~7– 10 days under ideal conditions
- Reproductive output: females can lay hundreds of eggs over their lifetime (e.g., ~400 eggs)
- Age at sexual maturity: 7-10 days old
- Lifespan: adults often live only several weeks (e.g., ~30–50+ days in laboratory conditions)
- Parental care: very little - eggs are laid on a substrate and then left to develop on their own
- High offspring mortality: Most offspring likely die before they themselves can reproduce
- The percentage of eggs that make it to reproductive adults in the wild is estimated to be roughly 1–10%, depending on environmental conditions.
American Robin (Turdus migratorius)
- Eggs per clutch: usually 3–5 eggs per nesting attempt
- Breeding frequency: often 1–3 broods per year, depending on conditions
- Parental care: both parents feed and protect chicks for ~2 weeks until they fledge; after fledging, young are mostly independent
- Lifespan: typically 2–5 years in the wild
- Only about 25ௗ% of young robins survive their first year after leaving the nest.
- This means roughly 1 in 4 chicks makes it past the vulnerable early period toward adulthood
K-selected vs r-selected
A spectrum of reproductive strategies
- r-selected species: produce many offspring, invest little in each
- K-selected species: produce few offspring, invest heavily in each
- Different species fall at different points along this spectrum
- Ie., you may fall on one end or the other, but you can also fall in the middle, or anywhere in between! Get into groups!
- Fill out the worksheet
- Think about the different strategies used by our three study species
- Think about the benefits of each strategy
- Think about the costs of each strategy
- This should have you thinking about fitness
- Think about the trade-offs built into these different strategies
