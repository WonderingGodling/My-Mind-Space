#### BACTERIAL CELL WALL

##### Bacterial Cell Wall Function
- surrounds plasma membrane
- Maintains cell shape
-   Protects cell from osmotis lysis and toxisity
- Makes some viruses stronger
- Mycoplasmas and Chlamydia sp. have no cell wall
- Bacterial cell wall synthesis is targeted by antibiotics

### Gram Reaction
Hans Christian Gram (Danish physician) discovered grams in bacterial walls in 1884
- **Crystal violet** stains cells purple  
- Lugol’s iodine forms a complex with Crystal violet  
- Gram-negative cells lose this complex when exposed to ethanol
- Gram-positive cells retain purple complex  
- Safranin counterstain Dyes Gram-negative cells red  
- Counter stained Gram-positive cells stay purple

#### Peptidoglycan
- Cross-linking between strands forms a giant mesh-like structure
- Peptidoglycan sacculus is rigid but elastic
- Thickness of peptidoglycan determines Gram reaction (thick=positive, thin=negative)
- Carbohydrate backbone of 2 alternating hexose sugars
	- N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)
	- N-acetylmuramic acid  (NAM)
		- NAM residues are cross-linked to peptides

#### Gram-positive Cell Wall
Single layer of peptidoglycan outside plasma membrane

##### Teichoic acids
- Polymers of glycerol or ribitol joined by phosphate groups  
- Wall teichoic acids - covalently linked to NAM residues of peptidoglycan  

##### Lipoteichoic acids 
- covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane 
- Anchors cell wall to plasma membrane - maintains cell structure  
- Facilitates attachment of Gram-positive pathogens

#### Gram-negative Cell Wall
- More complex
- Two distinct layers
	- Thin peptidoglycan layer
	- thick outer membrane
- Periplasmic space contains:
	- Thin layer of peptidoglycan
	- Proteins involved in nutrient acquisition
		- (Hydrolytic enzymes)
		- (Transport proteins)
	-  Enzymes that modify toxic compounds
		- E.g Beta lactamase break down antibiotics
	- Enzymes for peptidoglycan synthesis
- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
	- contains both lipid and carbohydrate
	- Lipid A
	- Core polysaccharide
	- O side chain/antigen
- Porins
	- Span outer membrane
	- Allow passage of nutrients and hydrophilic molecules of low Molecular weight

#### Lipopolysaccharide
- Contributes to the negative charge on bacterial cell surface
- Stabilises outer membrane structure
- Permeability barrier, restricting entry of antibiotics, detergents
- Protects pathogenic bacteria from host defences
- Lipid A portion - endotoxin 

#### Plasma Membrane
- Prevents entry of hydrophilic and charged molecules
- Bacterial cells contain hopanoids
	- Similar to cholesterol
	- Regulate membrane rigidity
	- Permeability barrier

##### Fluid mosaic model
- Bilayer of amphipathic phospholipids  
- Outer surface of hydrophilic heads  
- Inner surface of hydrophobic tails

#### Cell Envelope Layers Outside Cell Wall
- Capsule  
- Well organised layer that’s not easily washed off  
- Mainly polysaccharide  
- Some are made of protein  
- Pathogens - attach to surfaces and resist phagocytosis  
- Protect against desiccation (contain lots of water)

#### CYTOPLASM

##### Nucleoid
- Supercoiled into nucleoid structure with no nuclear membrane (allowing chromosomes to be longer than the cell)
- Single (haploid) circular chromosome (dsDNA)
- Encodes all the essential genes
- Plasmids (dsDNA molecule independent of chromosome)

##### Ribosomes
- site of protein synthesis
- Excluded from the nucleoid
- Composed primarily of rRNA
- Site of action of some antibiotics

##### Inclusion Bodies
- Can take form of granules, crystals or globules
- Serve as energy and nutrient reserves
	-  Abundant under favourable conditions
	- Carbon often stored as poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) inclusions
	- Phosphate stored as polyphosphate granules

##### Bacterial Endospores
- Dormant cells, formed within a mother cell
- Form in response to environmental stress
- Core surrounded by other layers
- Extremely resistant to heat, UV radiation, chemical disinfectants, desiccation

#### APPENDAGES

##### Flagella
- Allow bacteria to swim  
	- Towards nutrients  
	- Away from toxic substances  
	- Molecular motor powered by ATP
- Made of 3 parts: 
	- Filament (made of flagellin protein)  
	- Hook  
	- Basal body

###### Flagella Distribution Pattern
- Monotrichous
- Lopotrichous
- Amphitrichous
- Peritrichous

##### Pili
- Pilus (Latin for hair)
	- Fine appendages thinner and shorter than flagella  
	- Grow by adding subunits of pilin protein to their base


## Week 3 Bacterial growth and Genetics
![](https://i.imgur.com/5IQeekL.png)

### Bacterial growth and replication
**Binary fission:**
- Process results in two identical daughter cells  
- Time to division depends on environmental factors and species  
- Responsible for characteristic arrangement of cells  
- Growth is exponential - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64,  
- Rapid growth allows rapid evolution of traits by mutation or recombination

Bacterial growth starts with chromosome replication
Septation/division follows

Lag: inactivity
stationary: equal replication and death rate

#### Measurement of bacterial growth
Can be measured directly or indirectly
Direct:
- Microscopy
- Membrane filtration (mostly for water)
- Plate counts and viable counts - aerobic or anaerobic

Indirect:
- [[Uni/4BM024 Microbiology/Microbiology#Turbidity\|Turbidity]] using spectrophotometry
- Biomass
- Measuring cell products - C0

##### The viable count
Allows the approximate quantity of living organisms measured from a sample
Examples for Bacteria and yeasts: 
- Spread plates  
- Pour plates  
- Miles and Misera
Doesn't take into account viable but non-culturable organisms (underestimate)

##### Turbidity
Bacterial Number can be estimated using spectroscopy.  
When a growth curve is plotted using plate counts and the optical density of a sample is high (550 - 600 nm) then the bacterial number can be determined using only turbidity

##### Growth can be used to identify an organism
As bacterial cells grow they utilise nutrients/carbon sources in different ways producing enzymes, allowing a metabolic fingerprint to be obtained (specific to the organism)  

Many systems developed to exploit differences:
Manual -agar plates - biochemical tests  
Mechanised - robotic biochemical assays  

### The bacterial chromosome
- Double stranded circular DNA molecule
- Condensed into the nucleiod
- No nuclear membrane
- Chromosome is unpaired - haploid
- Encodes all the genes required for essential cell functions

#### Chromosome Replication
Must happen for cell division
- Replication is semi-conservative - each copy made contains one new (daughter) and one old strand (parent)  
- Replication starts from a specific site the Origin of Replication (ori C)  
- Bi-directional  
- Uses a large collection of enzymes - Replisome

#### Chromosome size
- Size varies significantly between species  
	- Can infect more species - larger chromosomes
- Efficient methods for genome sequencing available only from 1995  
- whole genome “shotgun” sequencing  
- Venter & Smith: 1st to sequence Haemophilus influenzae & Mycoplasma genitalium  
- Now many available - whole genomes sequenced through automated processes - important strains  

### Bacterial gene expression
![](https://i.imgur.com/brwkY85.png)

#### Operons  
- Functionally linked genes are grouped together  
- expression controlled by a single operator (called OPERONs)  
	- All the genes in an operon are transcribed onto one large messenger RNA molecule  
- ensures that all the genes required for a particular metabolic task are expressed and active at the same time

#### Control of gene expression  
Controlled by proteins which regulate the rate of gene transcription: 
- REPRESSORs (negative control - down regulate)  
- ACTIVATORs (positive control - up regulate) 
- REGULONs: a group of operons that is co-regulated - e.g. toxins 
Can be specific proteins or products such as levels of catabolites - glucose  


#### Plasmids

Extra-chromosomal material replicated independently from host chromosome and aren't essential for survival  
- Thousands of different plasmids exist  
	- 300 isolated from strains of E. coli alone  
	- Possible to make them in the lab - plasmid vectors for cloning

##### Spread naturally by CONJUGATION  
Replication is similar to chromosome replication and starts at the origin (ori V)
Between a donor cell and recipient cell - sex pilus  
Typically circular, DS and < 5% size of chromosomes - 1 to 5 x 105 bp  


##### Medical importance of plasmids
###### Antibiotic resistance  
Aka R factors were first discovered in Japan in 1959
Increase of R plasmids correlates with increasing use of antibiotics
Usually enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic:
- β- lactamases - penicillin resistance  
- Prevent uptake by modifying cell wall  


### Mutation and recombination
![](https://i.imgur.com/e02m9FR.png)

#### Mutation in bacterial genes  
An inheritable change within a nucleotide (DNA) sequence. This can be:
- spontaneous  (natural radiation, errors during DNA replication)  
- induced  (chemical mutagens)

#### Types of mutation  
- Point mutation - affects one base pair  
- Insertion or deletion of large DNA fragment  
- Inversions and duplications

#### Examples of mutations altering gene function  
- Replacement of nucleotide resulting in amino acid substitution in a protein (missense) 
- Premature termination of protein synthesis (nonsense)  
- Change in expression levels due to changed regulation  
	- deletions or insertions

#### Recombination  
- Genes in two separate bacterial cells brought together in one  
- Occurs by transfer of genetic information between bacteria (COMMON GENE POOL)  
- Swap genes through horizontal gene transfer  
- Includes genes on plasmids  
- Happens through - Transformation, Conjugation and transduction

#### Transformation  
- Uptake of pure (naked) DNA from medium surrounding cell  
- Released into medium from lysed cells  
- DNA must integrate into chromosome to transform recipient cell (Transformants)  
- Can be induced in the lab (Plasmids)

#### Transduction  
- DNA transferred cell to cell by Bacteriophages (bacterial viruses)  
- Bacteriophage picks up partially degraded bacterial DNA by mistake, making new virus (Transducing phage)  
- Not all bacteriophages can transduce and not all bacteria are transducible

#### Conjugation  
- Cell-to-cell contact allowing transfer of DNA  
- Plasmids are self-transmissible by CONJUGATION  
	- encode the sex pilus and other transfer genes (tra region) 
	-  is the major mechanism of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes on R plasmids

## Week 4 Terrestrial Microbiology Part 1: Soil as a Habitat
![](https://i.imgur.com/1JYANrs.png)

### Soil

### Types of soil
![](https://i.imgur.com/KFBr4I8.png)
Most of Earths soil is mineral soil (less than 20% carbon)
\> 20% is organic soil

Soil Organic Matter (SOM):  all living, or once-living, materials within, or added to, the soil
- Retain nutrients, maintaining soil structure, hold water for plants  
- Can be degraded by microbes

#### SOM
Large influence on biological, chemical & physical dynamics of soil  
SOM can be enhanced using fertiliser

|           Nitrogen            |            Phosphorus             |
| :---------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
| Many soils Have limited N2 Content |   Excess into lakes and streams   |
| nitrates in water (Health implications)  | Excessive growth of Cyanobacteria |



#### Production of SOM
Three step process with breakdown of:  
1. Soluble carbohydrates & proteins  
2. Complex CHOs e.g. cellulose  
3. Very resistant material e.g. lignin (complex oxygen- containing organic polymer)

## Week 5 Nutrition and Respiration
### random information to start
Cells are NCHOPS
Most Abuntant Macromolecules: Proteins
Cofactors And Enzymes Manipulate Internal Reactions
        Cofactors can be classified into two types: prosthetic groups (inorganic) and coenzymes (organic)
Glycolysis is a thing
Krebs Cycle is also a thing
Anaerobic less energy

Actual Lesson:
### Facts- bacterial nutrition & respiration  
- Cells are primarily composed of the elements H, O, C, N, P and S.  
- Proteins are the most abundant class of macromolecules in the cell.  
- Apart from enzymes, some other compounds involved in controlling metabolic  
as well as chemical reactions of a body are cofactors.  
- Cofactors are non-protein chemical compounds which are termed helper  
molecules. There are two types of cofactors viz coenzymes and prosthetic  
groups.  
- A nearly universal pathway for the catabolism of glucose is the Embden-  
Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, also called Glycolysis.  
- Krebs cycle is also called TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) or Citric acid cycle.  
- Anaerobic respiration transfers less energy than aerobic respiration.

### Need for Nutrients  
- Growth defined as increase in number of cells  
- Reproduce by binary fission  
- In order to grow, bacteria need nutrients to supply energy

### Composition of a Microbial Cell  
- Water: 70-80% of wet weight of the cell  
- Macromolecules & their building blocks:  
- Proteins: ................  
- Nucleic acids:..........  
- Lipids:................  
- Polysaccharides:............  
- Proteins: Around 55 % of cell dry weight

### Nutritional Requirements  
- Macronutrients vs. Micronutrients  
- Macronutrients (CHNOPS) required in large amounts  
- Essential elements for bacterial growth  
- Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, etc.  
- P, S, K, Mg and Se combined less than 5% of cell dry weight

### Micronutrients/Trace metals  
- Required in very small amounts  
- Function as cofactors for enzymes  
- Iron: cellular respiration  
- Boron, Chromium, Cobalt, Copper, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel,  
Tungsten, Vanadium, Zinc  
- Growth factors: mainly organic.  
- E.g. vitamins which function as coenzymes; Nicotinic acid (Niacin) is  
a precursor of NAD + ; Riboflavin is a precursor of FAD.

### Types of Bacterial Nutrition  
- Autotrophic Nutrition  
- Manufactures organic materials  
from inorganic raw material  
- Photoautotrophs  
- Bacteriochlorophyll (Purple bacteria)  
- Chlorobium chlorophyll (Green S bacteria)  
- Carotenoids  
- Oxygen is not evolved

### Autotrophic nutrition  

#### Oxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria  
- They use H 2O as an electron donor and oxygen is produced in the reaction.  
- They do not possess chloroplasts  
- Photosynthetic pigments are present in the cytosol.  
- 6CO 2 + 12H 2O + light energy → C 6H 12O 6 + 6O 2 + 6H 2O  
- Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) perform oxygenic photosynthesis.  

#### Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria  
- Most of the photosynthetic bacteria are anoxygenic  
- They do not utilise water as an electron donor, instead, they use H 2S, H 2 or thiosulphate  as reducing agent and hydrogen sources.  
- Photosynthetic pigment: Bacteriochlorophyll (Purple bacteria)  
- Chlorobium chlorophyll (Green S bacteria)  
- Oxygen is not evolved

### Chemoautotrophs  
- Produce their organic food from inorganic raw materials with the help of energy derived form exergonic  
chemical reactions. They use this energy for their metabolic needs.  
1. Sulphur oxidising bacteria e.g. Thiobacillus thioxidans oxidises sulphur to sulphate state:  
2H2S + O2 → 2S + 2H2O + Energy  
2. Nitrifying bacteria: e.g. Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus obtain energy by oxidising ammonia to nitrite  
NH4+ + 2O2 → NO2  
- + 2H2O + Energy  
Nitrocystis and Nitrobacter oxidises nitrites to nitrates  
NO2  
- + O2 → 2NO3- + Energy  
1. Iron Bacteria: Ferrobacillus obtain energy by oxidising ferrous compounds to ferric forms:  
4FeCO3 + 6H2O + O2 → 4Fe(OH) 3 + 4CO2 + Energy  
2. Methanomonas, oxidises methane into CO2 and H2O  
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O + Energy  
3. Carbon monoxide bacterium: Carboxydomonas, oxidises CO to CO2 for obtaining energy  
2CO + O2 → CO2 + Energy

### Heterotrophic Nutrition
Rely on others for their nutrition needs as they can’t manufacture their food  
#### Saprophytes  
- Feed on dead or decaying matter.  
- Fungi, bacteria generally come under the category of saprophytes.  
- Referred to as nature's scavengers because they feed on dead and decaying substances thus,  
cleaning our earth.  
- These organisms release enzymes that break down the dead bodies of animals and plant remains,  
hence working as scavengers.  
- They also release materials after the breakdown of organic matter that makes the soil fertile and  
creates humus.  
#### Parasites  
- Parasitism is defined as the relationship between different species in which one organism lives on  
or in the other organism and benefits from it by causing some harm.  
- e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium tetani, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae,  
Salmonella typhi
####   Symbiotic  
- Bacteria that live in a symbiotic relationship with other organisms.  
- Like rhizobium bacteria associated with root nodules, both the host and the pathogen  
benefit from the symbiotic interaction.  
- Plants provide a safe haven for rhizobium bacteria, which assists plants in nitrogen  
fixation.  
- Rhizobium bacteria dwell in nodules or on the roots of legumes in the soil.  
- They create a symbiotic relationship with the legume in the root nodule and benefit  
from the plant's nutrients.  
- As a result, nitrogen is produced for the process of nitrogen fixation, also known as  
biological nitrogen-fixing.

### Bacterial metabolism  
- Carbon and energy are required for  
- Cell structure  
- Synthesis of enzymes, nucleic acids, polysaccharides,  
phospholipids  
- Maintenance and repair  
- Growth and multiplication  
- Transport  
- Motility

### High energy compounds  
- Energy released from redox reactions is transferred  
to phosphate compounds in the form of high  
energy phosphate bonds  
- Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- ADP Cycle  
- Main carrier generated during exergonic reactions  
and used to drive endergonic reactions

### Bacterial Growth Curve  
- Lag phase, log phase, stationary phase, and death phase  
- Factors influencing each phase  
- Nutrition concentration.  
- Temperature.  
- pH.  
- Gas conditions  
- Water  
- Osmotic pressure

### Overview of Bacterial Respiration  
Definition of respiration in bacteria  
- Respiration is the chemical process by which organic compounds release  
energy.  
- The compounds change into different ones by exergonic reactions (Royal  
Society of Biology).

### Types of Respiration  

#### Aerobic Respiration
-  Cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy

#### Anaerobic Respiration
- Cellular respiration does not use oxygen to produce energy
Fermentation: Glucose → Alcohol + Carbon dioxide + Energy

### Types of Bacterial Respiration  

#### Aerobic: Occurs in the presence of oxygen  
- Obligate aerobes: Can respire only aerobically e.g. Mycobacterium  
tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis.  
- Facultative aerobes: Respire aerobically under normal conditions but  
switch over to anaerobic mode of respiration if oxygen becomes deficient  
e.g. Rhodopseudomonas.  

#### Anaerobes: Occurs without oxygen  
- Obligate anaerobes: Can respire only anaerobically e.g. Clostridium  
botulinum.  
- Facultative anaerobes: Respire anaerobically under normal conditions  
but switch over to aerobic mode of respiration if oxygen becomes  
available e.g. Escherichia coli.

### Aerobic Respiration- Glycolysis  

#### Catabolic or Anabolic?  
- No oxygen required  
- Although it doesn't require oxygen, hence  
its purpose in anaerobic respiration, it is also  
the first step in cellular respiration.  
- In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the  
citric acid cycle and undergoes oxidative  
phosphorylation leading to the production of  
more ATP molecules.  
- In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate converts  
to lactate through anaerobic glycolysis.  
- Occurs in Cytoplasm  
- Oxidative phosphorylation is a cellular  
process that harnesses the reduction of  
oxygen to generate high-energy phosphate  
bonds in the form of adenosine  
triphosphate (ATP)

#### The aphotic zone  
- Defined as a place where <1% of sunlight penetrates  
- Depending on turbidity extends from 200-300 - sea floor  
- Divided into bathyal (200 - 2000M), abyssal (2000-6000M and hadal (6000M - sea bed) zones  
- All life here relies on POM and DOM

##### Microbes of the aphotic zone  
- All microbes are heterotrophic and lithotrophic  
- Nutrients are very limited and comes from sinking detritus and colonisation of sinking particles  
	- Marine snow - faecal pellets, planktonic tests and diatomaceous debris that flocculates as it sinks  
	- Colonised during its fall and mineralised  
- <1% of photosynthetically derived material remains once on sea bed

#### Microbial metabolism   
1. How the organism obtains carbon:  
- Autotrophic - carbon is obtained from inorganic compounds e.g CO2  
- Heterotrophic - carbon is obtained from organic compounds e.g. sugars  
2. How the organism derives their energy:  
- Chemotrophic - energy is obtained from external chemical compounds  
- Phototrophic - energy is obtained from light  
3. How they generate reducing equivalents  
- Lithotrophic - reducing equivalents (electrons) are obtained from inorganic compounds (H2,NH3, CO, H2S, SO42-, Fe )  
- Organotrophic - reducing equivalents (electrons) are obtained from organic compounds (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins, lipids)  
These terms can be combined to describe the organism - e.g. photolithoautotrophs (plants), chemoorganoheterotrophs (animals)

#### The Benthic zone  
- Includes where the water column meets the ocean floor and the sediment on the bottom 
- Includes barophilic, thermophilic and psychrophilic organisms - complex nutrition

- Can only survive at pressures up to 1100 atm.  
- No real upper limit reached in the laboratory  
- Most rely on Chemolithotrophic metabolism  
- Carbon provided by marine snow for heterotrophs  
- Hydrothermal vents and cold seeps can provide reduced inorganic power for growth

#### Cold seeps  
- Life in the cold  
- Cold seeps are regions were methane or petroleum leek through the ocean floor  
- Pools of Methane hydrates are produced by Archaea in cages of crystalline water !  
- Covert acetate to methane that psycrophilic methanogens can use for nutrition.  
- Many form symbioses with large slow growing animals
