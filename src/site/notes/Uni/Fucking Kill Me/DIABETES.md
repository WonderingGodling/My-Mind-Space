What diabetes is (characterised by high blood glucose)  
Chronically high blood glucose concentration that is not being utilised 

Why do we have high blood glucose?  
lack of insulin production/sensitivity leading to glucose not being broken down

What is insulin and its role in the body? – how can this lead to diabetes?  
Insulin is a horemone that promotes the conversion of glucose into glycogen and allows glucose to enter the body’s cells. the body can become resistant to glucose or stop producing it which leads to a build up of glucose in the blood

How does type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ?  
Type one is when your pancreas doesnt produce insulin. Its a lifelong condition but must be managed to prevent serious health problems. type two is when your pancreas produces less and/or your body is resistant to the insulins effects, this can be treated to avoid health problems

How can this impact our patient?  
diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels which can complicate possible treatment options

What are the symptoms?  
weight loss, glucose in urine, wounds taking longer to heal

Short-term complications?  
hypoglycaemia diabetic ketoacidosis , hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state, frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, sweating, 

Long-term complications?  
cardiovascular disease/blood vessel damage, increased risk of dimentia, retinopathy, nephropathy. neuropathy

How can we avoid these complications?  
Managing your blood glucose concentration, blood pressure, blood fats

What medication would be appropriate?  
insulin, meglitinide, incrin memetics

How do we monitor the condition?  
blood testing
