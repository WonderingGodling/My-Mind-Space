- Invented in 1984
     - creator, geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys of the University of Leicester

- November 1983. 15-year-old Lynda Mann
        - raped and strangled
        - semen sample
                - Collected Before Dna Fingerprinting
- July 1986 15-year-old Dawn Ashworth
        -  raped and strangled
        - Semen Sample
                - obviously connected because crime was slow in the 80s
- Richard Burkland, a 17-year-old
        - admitteed to the second crime
-  Alec Jeffreys (Noting genetic fingerprintingh has worjked once before (in paternity and immigration cases), threw his hat into the ring)
        - Richard Burkland’s DNA did not match the semen
                - Assuming the semen did match
                - the first ever exoneration of an innocent man using DNA fingerprinting
                        - Less interesting when you consider hes the reason he was under scrutiny
- January 1987
        - Leicestershire Constabulary 
        -  conduct a huge DNA profiling project, collecting DNA samples from over 4000 local men between the ages of 17 and 34 (Fifteen year olds dont fuck each other and all 35+ year olds have erectile disfunction)
                - six months down the line a match had not been found.
        - Ian Kelly was caught bragging about being paid £200 to submit a DNA sample on behalf of a work colleague (At A Pub)
                - detained and questioned. (Cops are so subtle)
                        - covering for Colin Pitchfork
- 19th September 1987, Pitchfork was arrested
        - matched his DNA
                -  he admitted to raping and killing the two girls and assulting two more
                        - Married in 81 so....wifes fault?
                                - I mean he had already been arrested for indecent exposure so she knew what she was signe=ing up for
                                - Sexually assulted a 16 year old in 79 and 85
                                -  admitted to [exposing himself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure "Indecent exposure") to more than 1,000 women, a compulsion that began in his early teens
                                        - He Claimed The strangling was to protect his identity but investigato=rs beleived it was for a perverted/sadistic rush of addrenaline
                        - life imprisonment on 23rd January 1988
                        - and 10 years for raping the victims
                        - and two three years (one for each admitted count of sexual assault)
                        - and three years for perverting the course of justice
                                - but dont worry because he ran those concurrently
                                - And Minimised To 30, Then 28 Years

    - Weird because all
-  DNA evidence alone is not enough to secure a conviction today
        - progressively faster and more sensitive


- DNA contains regions in which short sequences of bases are repeated multiple times
        - the exact number of repeats varies from person to person (Called short tandem repeats)
        -  two sets of STRs (each parent)
        -  Picking loci that are distant from one another decreases the porbability of similarities being by chance
- Jeffreys used a type of repeat unit containing repeat segments that were hundreds of bases long
        -  isolated and separated DNA fragments into size-dependent bands with gel electrophoresis
        - DNA analysis took six to eight weeks
- 1990s, the forensics community switched to STRs
- Capillary electrophoresis instruments are much faster
- polymerase chain reaction uses enzymes t0 “amplify” the amount of DNA in a sample by copying it many times
        - Short pieces of DNA called primers identify specific regions of the genome and serve as starting points for copying them
        - Before the boost in sensitivity provided by PCR, large samples such as bloodstains the size of a dime or a quarter were needed to get enough DNA for profiling

-  “In the early days, a DNA case didn’t get worked unless there was a suspect and a blood sample from that suspect
                -  DNA could be used to include or exclude a suspect
                - After governments started maintaining databases of DNA profiles, the incentive for running unknown samples skyrocketed.
                                - the sample might match Someone In The Database Or Provide A Match For A Different Sample POnce Included
                - _CODIS_ over 13 million records as of May 2018

- The sensitivity of PCR allows investigators to generate DNA profiles from smaller samples than were possible in the early days of DNA profiling
        - Being previously unable to generate whole profiles
        - However this leads to more profiles being identified due to oversensitivity
-  PCR amplification might drop or add a repeat unit
        -  a threshold approach works unless you want to identify a minor contributor in a mixture
        - now algorithms to determine which combinations of DNA profiles better explain the observed data (known as probabilistic genotyping)

- possible future dna sequencing methods
        - DNA sequences are analyzed by using arrays of single-stranded DNA fragment
        - and  such methods should be compatible with existing databases.
        - Dna sequencing can be used to determine certain physical chatracteristics as well as str

# The Invention
The process for DNA fingerprinting was invented in the year 1984 by the geneticist known as Sir Alec Jeffreys From the University of Leicester and had two debut cases, one featuring a child of unknown origin and one featuring semen with an equal number of connections. One of the pros of DNA analysis at the dawn of its creation was that it would not need additional resources to investigate as many of the samples would have  been collected anyway as evidence.

## The First Victim (Lynda Mann)
In November of 1983, a fifteen year old woman known as Lynda Mann was found having been raped and strangled to death. The only evidence found was a semen sample (that was taken before the invention of any DNA analysis)

## The Second Victim (Dawn Ashworth)
The case ran cold until July of 1986 where another fifteen year old miss of the name Dawn Ashworth was also found to have been raped and strangled to death. The crime scene once again singularly resulting in a semen sample taken from the body.

Obviously these two crimes, though years apart, had to be done by the same person, so invvestigations began once again to catch the perpetraitor.


# The First DNA Exoneration
During the revived investigation one Richard Burkland (under extreme legal pressure and public suspicion) admitted to having committed the second crime. The reason he didn't admit to committing the first is that despite police being under the impression that the two crimes were done by the same man, they could only provide evidence to him being involved in the first one.

Around the same time Alec Jeffreys noted that genetic fingerprinting had worked in the past to find specific people (during a case regarding a Ghanaian child's father and immigration status) and thus suggested that it should be used to math the seventeen year old's DNA to the DNA of the sampled semen and with no match being found Burkland was officially declared innocent of the crime he had admitted to. Tis makes him the first person to ever be exonerated via the use of genetic fingerprinting

# The Database That Started It All

Leicestershire Constabulary gets involved in the investigation after seeing the potential that DNA based identification holds and proceeds to conduct a DNA profiling project wherein over 4000 local men (for some reason) between the ages of 17 and 34 had donated their DNA to help locate whomsoever was the man behind the crimes. Six months later no such man had been found.  

## The Substitute
Until, while having a couple of drinks, a mr Ian Kelly had been overheard bragging about having been paid two hundred pounds to submit a DNA sample under his coworkers name. Ian himself hadnt been requested to submit one himself because he lived outside of where investigatiors had been lead to beleive the criminal lived. Of course, Kelly was detaimned and interrogated unt8il he had given up the name of our Colin Pitchfork

# The Exhibition Addict: Colin Pitchfork

In 1979, Colin Pitchfork isolated and sexually assulted a sixteen year old. Despite his indecent exposure arrest, in 1981, he got married to Carol Pitchfork (at some point hey had two sons but all of the three have since denounced him). In 1983, there was Lynda Mann. 1985: the armed sexual assult of a sixteen year old under the threat of death. Dawn Ashworth was less than a year later in 1986. He had actually admitted to having exposed himself to more than a thousand women since his early teenage years but we're focusing on his ultimate conviction.

## The Arrest
Pitchfork was arrested on the 19th of September 1987 and his DNA was very quickly matched to the semen samples. Seeing no way out, he did confess to raping and killing  Mann and Ashworth as well as assulting the two other young women I Mentioned. He tried to claim that killing them was to protect his identity which, if true, would alleviate his charge to voluntary manslaughter since the murders would have been out of panic rather than out of malice. That being said investigators beleived, instead, that the stranglings were part of a sadistic nature and therefore purposeful and tied to the rape itself.

## The Charge
His sentance was decided on the 23rd of january 1988: Life imprisonment along with ten years for the rape of the two victims, six years for the two counts of admitted sexual assult, and three additional years for perverting the course of justice (paying Ian Kelly to tak ehis place). These years were to be served concurrently and a minimum of at first thirty but later twenty-eight years was to be carried out.
