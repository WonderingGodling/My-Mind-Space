Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On The Test So do we Need To Be Here? 
That Wasnt Rhetorical; No Is The Answer

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words

This Lecturer, Despite Not having Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] As A Man who Knows What hes Doing

...

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

[Told To Arrive Early]
[No Lecturer, No Instruction]
9k!
None Of The [[Branches/People\|People]] I Talk To Are Even Here So Im Just Gonna Die

I Feel Like My Bones Want To Eat [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Whole
I Guess Back To Video Games :D

I Keep Feeling Like This Is It; Im Finally Going To Break Then Someone Messages [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And Im Like "Im Fine Why Do You Ask :)"
Really Channelling My Inner [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/TMA/Aspects/Spider\|Spider]]

havent.... Havent Slept, Dont Really Want To
Its Mothers Day Tomorrow And I Havent Preped, Dont Really Want To
Played....I Dont Even Remmber Anymore But I Di Play Disco Elysium With [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Yesterday "With [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]]" That Was Kinda Nice
Absolutely Putting Out [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] With My Enrgy Today And Its Killing [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

Probably Gonna Break Down And Do The Thing Later Which I Love Doing So Yay
Oh And The Dreamer Messaged [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And That Freaked [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Out Because I Thought They Didnt Wanna Talk To [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] So Idk Maybe (Probably) Im Just Paranoid

# Also

They Updated My Uni Timetable!
I Actually Have Uni Tomorrow Morning, Thats Lame :/
9-12 Dx
And Chemistry On Wednesday Which Never Happens

Actually Doing Lessons And "Learning" Now But Every Zone Out Is Stressful!
ACCIDENTAL EXCLAMATION
And Caps

Absolutely Gone And I Answered A Question
That Brought [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Back
I Should Spend Some Time Parsing This Shit

He Wanted Us To Look At A Thing AnD I Stopped And Then Hes Already Like Moved On Blegh
