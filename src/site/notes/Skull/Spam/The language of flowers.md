Sappho wrote an exquisite ode to the rose; and Thomas Moore, has thus transferred to the English the burning language of the Lesbian maid :

"If Jove would give the leafy bowers 
A queen for all their world of flowers, 
The rose would be the choice of Jove, 
And blush the queen of every grove. 
Sweetest child of weeping morning, 
Gem, the breast of earth adorning, 
Eye of flow'rets, glow of lawns. 
Bud of beauty, nursed by dawns : 
Soft the soul of love it breathes, 
Cypria's brow with magic wreathes; 
And to the Zephyr's warm caresses. 
Diffuses all its verdant tresses, 
Till glowing with the wanton's play, 
It blushes a diviner ray."
