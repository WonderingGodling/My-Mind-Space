I send a pestilence and plague
Into your house, into your bed
Into your streams, into your streets
Into your drink, into your bread
Upon your cattle, on your sheep
Upon your oxen in your field
Into your dreams, into your sleep
Until you break, until you yield

I send the swarm, I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord

I send the thunder from the sky
I send the fire raining down

I send a hail of burning ice
On every field, on every town

I send the locusts on the wind
Such as the world has never seen
On every leaf, on every stalk
Until there's nothing left of green

I send my scourge, I send my sword
Thus saith the Lord
