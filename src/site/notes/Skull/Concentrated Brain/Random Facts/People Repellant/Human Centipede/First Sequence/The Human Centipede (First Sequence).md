# Summary

The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch independent body horror film written, directed and co-produced by [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]]. The film concerns a deranged German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and conjoins them surgically, mouth to anus, forming the eponymous "human centipede. It stars Dieter Laser as Josef Heiter, the creator of the centipede; and Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura as Heiter's victims.

According to Six, the concept arose from a joke he had made with friends about punishing a child molester by stitching his mouth to the anus of a "fat truck driver". Other sources of inspiration were Nazi medical experiments performed during World War II, such as those performed by [Josef Mengele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele "Josef Mengele") (Who Had Performed Numerous "Medical" [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People Repellant/Nazi human experimentation/Nazi human experimentation\|Experiments]] On Identical Twins, People With Heterochromia And People With Dwarfism Or Physical Abnormalities (Such As Stitching Them Together, Injecting Their Hearts With Chloroform And Removing Organs Without Painkiller)) at the Auschwitz concentration camp. 

When approaching investors to fund the project, Six did not mention the premise of the film for fear of putting off potential backers; financiers did not discover the full nature of the film until completion.

The film held its premiere at the London FrightFest Film Festival on 30 August 2009. It received a limited theatrical release in the United States on 30 April 2010. Despite a mixed critical reception, the film won several accolades at international film festivals. Two sequels that were also written and directed by Six—Full Sequence and Final Sequence—were released in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The entire trilogy was combined into a single film in 2016, titled Complete Sequence, which Six described as a "movie centipede" due to each Sequence leading into its successor while simultaneously working as a separate standalone film.

# Cast

Dieter Laser as Josef Heiter, a retired surgeon who specialised in the separation of conjoined twins, but in retirement is more interested in joining creatures together. Casting for the role of Heiter took place in Berlin, and Six intended to cast Laser before he had even read for the part, after Six saw a DVD of one of Laser's previous films. Laser had previously appeared in over 60 mostly German-language films, including [Der Unhold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheOgre(1996film) "The Ogre (1996 film)") and Baltic Storm (he speaks German in parts of First Sequence as well). Upon meeting him in Berlin, Six gave Laser a shot-by-shot explanation of Heiter's scenes, and Laser, impressed by Six's dedication and passion, agreed to take part in the film Laser contributed considerably to the development of Heiter's character. For example, because Heiter views the "centipede" as his pet, Laser felt that it was important that Heiter appear naked during a scene in which he swam in full view of his victims, because Laser said "you aren't ashamed to be naked" around a pet.
Ashley C. Williams as Lindsay, an American tourist, a friend of Jenny's, and the central section of the centipede. Auditioning for the roles of Jenny and Lindsay took place in New York City. Six said during the auditioning process, many actresses walked out of readings in disgust after hearing the full nature of the role. Others thought they would be able to take on the role, but found it was "too much" for them once they got onto their hands and knees behind another actor. Williams expressed concern about the nudity expected of her in the film, but took the role when she was assured it would be modest and of a non-sexual nature.
Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, an American tourist, a friend of Lindsay's, and the rear section of the centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie was one of several actresses to audition for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, the film's producer and sister of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]], and did not meet [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]], who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie was drawn to the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.
Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist and front section of the centipede. Having already acted in or written for a number of films and television shows (including popular American television series [Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes(U.S.TVseries) "Heroes (U.S. TV series)")), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.
Rene de Wit as Truck Driver, one of Heiter's victims. De Wit had previously worked with Six in his 2008 film I Love Dries.
Andreas Leupold as Detective Kranz, a police officer.
Peter Blankenstein as Detective Voller, a police officer.

# Plot

Lindsay and Jenny, tourists from New York visiting Germany, get a flat tire on their way to a night club. After refusing a ride from a dangerous looking truck driver, they walk through the woods looking for them when it begins to rain. They stumble upon a rural country house owned by a crazed, misanthropic psychopathic surgeon named Dr.Josef Heiter From Whom They seek help at the house. Dr. Heiter pretends that he is phoning for them when he serves the two young women water (drugged with Rohypnol) which upon drinking they pass out. He kidnaps them to a makeshift medical ward. Heiter kills a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". 

When the women wake up a second time, Heiter has secured a new male captive, Japanese tourist Katsuro.

The doctor explains to his three captives that he is a retired world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing humans together. He Describes In Detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. His prior experiment, the 3Dog, conjoined three Rottweilers into a "Siamese triplet"; all three dogs , also joined mouth-to-anus, died following the operation. Heiter has moved on to using human subjects.

After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter tells Lindsay that the middle dog of his creation experienced the most pain And decides to make her the middle part of the centipede as punishment. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay at the middle and Jenny at the rear; he removes both the upper and lower front teeth and lips of Lindsay and Jenny, and mutilates the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay to provide access to the rectums. He severs the ligaments of his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl.

Once the operation is complete, Heiter takes the centipede to his living room, takes photos, and passes a mirror around for the segments of the centipede to view their new form. Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet by caging the centipede in a dog kennel, forcing Katsuro to eat dog food at dinner, and belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. 

When Katsuro defecates after apologizing to the girls, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement. 

Heiter becomes irritated after being kept awake by the screaming of a caged Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak, but in Japanese) and by the constant moaning of the women, threatening to remove their vocal cords. 

When the centipede attempts to escape while Heiter is swimming, all three segments are beaten with the crop. 

Heiter is displeased with the realization that Lindsay is constipated. He proposes to use laxatives on Lindsay. However, before he can do this, he discovers that Jenny is dying from sepsis (suggesting that Lindsay may have already defecated into her mouth off-camera, which led to infection).

Two detectives, Kranz and Voller, visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the three tourists. Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation: a four-segment centipede. He offers the detectives water spiked with Rohypnol. After being given the drugged water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter. Their attempt to escape fails. Katsuro confesses to Heiter that he deserves this fate because he treated his family poorly, then takes his own life by slitting his throat with a glass shard, trapping the girls.

Upon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives conduct separate searches as Heiter, injured, hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his foot during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by fatally shooting Heiter in the head before succumbing to his wounds. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives.

# Human Centipede (First Sequence) Production 

## Writing

### Idea And Influences
The inspiration for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]] once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, and he began to develop the idea. 

He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of David Cronenberg and Japanese horror films. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over "unbelievable" monster films, and that he gets "a rash from too much political correctness." A major influence for The Human Centipede was Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1975 Italian drama film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike. Six has also expressed his love of the works of David Lynch. 

Further inspiration came from Six's previous role as a director on the Dutch series of Big Brother, where he had been able to observe people who "did [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|crazy]] things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched."

### Politics
Six has stated that The Human Centipede is, to an extent, a reflection on fascism. Dieter Laser, who played the antagonist Dr Heiter, said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations, and that as a German whose father participated in the war, he often felt "like a child whose father is in jail for murder." The inclusion of a German villain came from this, with Six citing both the German invasion of the Netherlands during World War II and the [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People Repellant/Nazi human experimentation/Nazi human experimentation\|Nazi medical experiments]] as inspiration. Laser stated in an interview with Clark Collis for Entertainment Weekly that he considered the film a "grotesque [parody] about the Nazi psyche". 

Heiter's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals, his surname (literally meaning "cheerful" in German) a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter, and his first name coming from Josef Mengele, who carried out [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People Repellant/Nazi human experimentation/Nazi human experimentation\|Experiments]] on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp. 

World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese. 

Six includes many horror film clichés in the first act, such as a broken-down car, lack of phone signal and very naïve victims. Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film, therefore making Dr Heiter's treatment of his victims more shocking.

Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede to create a language barrier between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film. 

Six stated in the director's commentary for The Human Centipede that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his "own nightmare."

### Funding
While seeking funding for the film, Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together. He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments. His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding. However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed. Six claimed that they were very happy with the finished film. Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the storyboard rather than a complete script. They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed.

# Production 

## Filming

Although The Human Centipede is set in Germany, principal photography took place in the Netherlands due to the neighbouring countries' similar landscapes. 

#### Set Locale
Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, such as a home theater which was converted to form Heiter's basement operating room, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]], which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. 

The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. 

#### Methodology
The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot on the last day of filming.

#### Directing
Laser remained in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting at the rest of the cast on set, and wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. 

He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. 

Laser was also happy for the other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also unintentionally hurt Williams during the scene where Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting.

#### Audio
The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is "training" his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, in much the same way as music was sometimes played in Nazi concentration camps.

Many of the sound effects in The Human Centipede were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat. 

#### Toll
Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming. Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a bit in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.

# Human Centipede (First Sequence) Production 

## Editing

#### Realism
The Human Centipede contains relatively few gory images; little of the surgical procedure is depicted directly no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be." Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being "100% medically accurate." Six said that the surgeon initially wanted nothing to do with his film, as he felt Six was "[[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|crazy]]" and the idea had "nothing to do with medical science." However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an IV drip. 

#### Centipede
The special effects team was led by Rob and Erik Hillenbrink, father and son. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear, and for the actor behind to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of "suit" the actors would be wearing.

#### In Post
When Heiter is operating on his victims, Jenny's teeth were digitally removed in post-production. However, other effects were relatively simple to create. Heiter's "three dog" was created by Photoshopping an image of three Rottweilers to create an image of dogs joined together. 

Colour grading was used extensively throughout the production of The Human Centipede. For example, at the end of the film when Lindsay is left between the dead bodies of Jenny and Katsuro, their skin tones were lightened to further emphasise that they were dead and Lindsay was still alive.

The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car breaks down was added digitally in post-production. The filmmakers had not been granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. 

When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, the use of a tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.

# Sequels

When [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]] began creating the Human Centipede sequels, he envisioned a trilogy that works as a "movie centipede". Each sequel opens with the ending of the previous film, as the events of that film influence said sequel. Although every film works as a standalone movie, they can all be connected to form a single 4.5-hour-long film.

While promoting The Human Centipede, Six stated that he had started work on a sequel to First Sequence, titled The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence). Shooting on a similar budget to the first film, Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic, disturbing and even "shittier" film; First Sequence being "My Little Pony compared with part two." Yennie stated at the May 2010 Weekend of Horrors that the sequel would contain "the blood and shit" that viewers did not see in the first film. The plot of Full Sequence involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast, and was given the tag-line "100% medically inaccurate".

The plot of Full Sequence involves a man who, after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of First Sequence, decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was "sexually violent and potentially obscene". The BBFC's report criticised the film as making "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as for the pleasure of the audience," and that the film was potentially in breach of the Obscene Publications Act, meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal. Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an 18 certificate in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version.

The third and final film in the trilogy, The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence), received a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says, "each film is a reaction to the other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." As Full Sequence was intended to make First Sequence look like My Little Pony in comparison, Final Sequence was intended to make Full Sequence resemble a Disney film. The movie features the tag-line "100% Politically Incorrect". Both Dieter Laser and Full Sequence star Laurence R. Harvey returned in starring, albeit different, roles.

The Human Centipede (Final Sequence) was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards in the categories of "Worst Director" and "Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off, or Sequel", respectively.

# Facts

#### Meta
Director [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]] showed a drawing of the human centipede to all the actresses who showed up to the casting sessions. Many actresses walked out in disgust after discovering what the role actually entailed.

When the Toronto Underground Cinema showed this film, there was a "centipede deal" where if two tickets were purchased, the third one would be free.

The actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of every day's filming due to being on their hands and knees all day long.

In the scene where Lindsay falls into the swimming pool, [Winter Williams](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2280521/?ref_=tttrv_tr)'s shivers were real as the heating was not working, so the water was really cold.

Some scenes of the movie are so controversial, some people walked out during test screenings.

[Dieter Laser](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0489504/?ref_=tttrv_tr) came up with the ideas to both smell the pus and lick the blood on the stairs.

The opening scene, which only featured [Dieter Laser](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0489504/?ref_=tttrv_tr) and [Rene de Wit](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1689242/?ref_=tttrv_tr), was shot on the last day of filming. Laser wore director [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/I Dont Know/Tom Six\|Tom Six]] mirror sunglasses for the scene.

Feces is simply what remains of food after most, if not all the nutrients have been absorbed from it by the body, although it usually retains some water. Because of this, the only person who could hypothetically survive living as part of a human centipede for more than a few weeks would be the person in front. The other members of the centipede would eventually die from lack of water, unless they receive intravenous fluids; they would most likely die due to nutritional deficiencies in that case. In the unlikely case that that doesn't kill them, ingesting fecal bacteria causing severe lung and stomach infections would.

The defecation in the mouth scene was done in a single take.

The two female leads were cast in New York City. [Akihiro Kitamura](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2162290/?ref_=tttrv_tr) auditioned via Skype.

Since [The Human Centipede (First Sequence) (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/?ref_=tttrv_tr) was marketed as "100% medically accurate," the doctors on [Hi Everybody! A Bad Medicine Podcast (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12499008/?ref_=tttrv_tr) use this film as their baseline for rating the medical accuracy of other films and TV shows. For example, they determined that [Saw II (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/?ref_=tttrv_tr) was "500% medically accurate," meaning it was five times more medically accurate than The Human Centipede (First Sequence).

Josef Heiter's first name references [Josef Mengele](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1394337/?ref_=tttrv_tr), a Nazi doctor who carried out torture experiments on prisoners in Auschwitz concentration camp. The surname Heiter, literally meaning "cheerful" in German, is a reference to lesser-known Nazi war criminals, doctors Fetter and Richter.

Feces is not simply the remains of food. It is mostly (70%-90%) intestinal bacteria. The remainder contains mucus, bile, dead epithelial cells from the intestinal lining, and compounds of skatole and thiols. Fecal matter is toxic. Humans cannot live by consuming it.

contains relatively few gory images; little of the surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in Empire, it is "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be."

The cage the human centipede was kept in was a real dog cage.

[Dieter Laser](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0489504/?ref_=tttrv_tr) came up with the idea of Dr. Heiter eating fruit from a can.

Ashlynn Yennie's debut.

The number on the license plate of the girls' rented car is DO-HC 6700. DO for Dortmund, a city in Germany close to the dutch border, and HC most likely for Human Centipede.

The special effects team was led by Rob and Erik Hillenbrink, father and son. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon.

[Akihiro Kitamura](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2162290/?ref_=tttrv_tr) wrote the monologue he says before his character commits suicide.

Body Count: 6

This is the only Human Centipede film where the villain dies at the end of the film.


#### Continuity
When Lindsay spills her drugged glass of water, it is nearly empty, and approximately 3/4 of an inch (one centimeter) of liquid remains. In the next scene, after Dr. Heiter goes downstairs and the woman says, "It's freaking me out!" the glass is half-filled with water again.

When the doctor joins the three for the first time and begins taking photos, he is using a Canon Digital Rebel. When the camera angle changes and shows him taking photographs again, he is shown to be using a Nikon camera.

While the captives climb the spiral staircase, they are bleeding and pools of blood can be seen on many of the steps. However, a moment later when the camera shows a shot of Dr. Heiter at the top of the stairs looking down the hallway by the bedroom, there is not a drop of blood on the floor where the three had crawled.

When Lindsay is running up the stairs with a bloody arm, she grabs onto a corner of the wall, but the blood was there before she touched it.

When Lindsay is in the pool her hairstyle changes between shots.

When Lindsay and Jenny are walking through the forest, one of them is holding a purse that constantly switches hands between shots.

When one of the policemen arrived in the house, he breaks the door of the room with the centipede, but the door was open before the mad doctor crawling to the pool room.

The front left tire of the girls' rental car blows out and is shown to be completely deflated, but in subsequent shots the tire is inflated normally.

As Lindsay is dragging an unconscious Jenny through the yard trying to make an escape, you can spot the pink feather from the dart in her back before Dr. Heiter takes the shot.

When the running Lindsay is trapped in a room, the blood she leaves on the door disappears then reappears.

When Dr. Heiter goes through the door to 'get a towel,' the light is on; when one police officer approaches the door, the light inside that room is off.

When Dr. Heiter is taking an unconscious Katsuro out of his car, you see Katsuro "help" Heiter by putting his right arm on the door frame to push himself up, so Heiter can carry him.

When the two girls realize they're lost in the woods, there are two scenes where the video is mirrored. This is evident from the car registration plates and the driver's seat which is on the right.

When the human centipede is being trained to fetch the newspaper, Lindsay can be seen flexing and extending her legs despite having the tendons of her knee cut to prevent this.

(at around 51 mins) Where three are in the cage and one of the women reaches to hold her friend's hand, the camera pans to the side. Here, Lindsay is clearly not connected rectum to mouth--her lips are visible with a gap of light between them and Katsuro's butt. Again this is visible in the pool scene and after Katsuro stabs the doctor's feet.

When Lindsey is hiding in the doctor's bedroom and screams, "You're a sick man; you need help!" you can see a face move in the mirror behind her (which is definitely not hers because of the hair).
