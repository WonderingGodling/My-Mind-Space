Girl Turned Into Spider
Thats All I Got
Alysa Never Said Right


## Alysa 
You are aware that you are under no obligation to read this right? In fact, I suggest you don't....But you Will won't you? Dying to know what I have to tell you. Fine. Since you're so hungry: Meet Alysa.

### Mystery Mound


Alysa woke up this morning, to a surprise, a small disk- no- Alysa woke up to a slab of something. She looked closer at it as her eyes adjusted to the dark room she had retreated to the previous night but not being able to make out what it could be, she forced herself up off of the floor and guided her own achey legs towards the door. Her hand slowly getting scratched by the poorly papered walls acted as her ownly guidence around the room. It stopped her not from stumbling over the uneven flooring. After feeling the frame of the door she grabbed onto the handle and opened it. Thought she opened it. She walked into the door. Of course, she tried again but to no avail.  Alysa centered herself. She knew these doors didnt get stuck. There's nothing near the door and shed have noticed if this one's hinges were rusting. The handle turns as well as it always does. That meant there was only one other possibility.

"What' I miss? He doesn' use this room. I thought this good one. But he- Why wou-" Then she remembered the mystery mound. If he locked the room then he most likely saw her hiding in here while she was asleep, it wouldnt be too much of a leap in judgment to assume that he could have left this for her to what? Clean? That doesnt make sense, of course it doesnt, but what else is there she can do? Look, touch, smell, hear...."No. No." She creeped  closer to where the thing was and kneeled in front of it, her pained groans drowning out the cracking sound her knees made. Knowing that there was no hope in seeing what he put there she tentatively poked it' as she did, it gave way to her finger. It was slimey, chunky, like a pile of freshly chewed gum spat onto the floor in unison. Cocking her ead towayds it provided no new sound to be heard. It wasnt breathing at least. If it were a creature it wasnt a live one. Alysa losts focus on the possible corpse, trying to fiigure out if he would have killed a dog to teach her a lesson about something or other or maybe just to laugh knowing shed have to clean it. "Ah!" the liquid touching The fur on her long ears made her jump straightout of her skin. Her breathing heavy, her heart drumming, her mind racing. 

It took quite some time to calm back down, aided by the realisation that if there were blood in the room with her, the space would be filled with a new tainted iron smell but, as it stands, the only thing she could smell was herself. "O.K. I clean."

Alysa looked at the floor in front of her as she kneeled in front of him- she knows to never look him in his dark, suffocating eyes, she also knows (or believes) that if she stays still enough he'll forget that she's there since that usually works.  "Fatass!" He calls from a few feet away, the volume makigng her ears involuntarily flatten against her skull but she moves her gaze up off of the floor and to his chest; while her eyes moved he crouched down slightly causing her to look lower. "You hungry, pig? I have a treat prepared for you." Alysa opened her mouth to speak but then thought better of it and nodded instead. "Close your eyes and stand up." There was a smile that could be heard through his voice; she never trusted his smiles but she didnt have a choice in her actions. Following his request she heard him move around her, the sound of metal scratching against itself and then another pair of footsteps that continued until they were directly in front of her.
