Went To A Lovejoy Concert And It Was Actually Really Fun
I Got To Town Early So I Walked Around And There Were So Many [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Kinda Just Looked/Vibed That They Were Definitely Also Going To The Concert
I Also Got Four Monsters And Was Going To Down Them All But Dan Took One (Which Is Understandable I Had A Lot Of Caffeine)

When I Got To The Venue It Was Like Two Hours Early But The Line Still Stretched Down The Entire Road And Around The Corner So I Joined The Line To Save A Space Which Was Definitely The Best Move
It Looked Like The Line Wrapped Around The Whole Block And I Was **Not** Standing At The Back Of That :)
We Saw So Many Cool Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] With Pride Flags And L'manburgh Flags (I Guess Those Are The Same Thing Now That I Think About It) But [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And Dan Signed The L'manburgh Flag Which Was Cool
We Also Saw One Or Two Juggalos! I Couldnt Tell If It Was The Same Person Walking Past [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Twice (In The Same Direcrtion) Or If It Was Two Different [[Branches/People\|People]] With Similar Outfits And Makeup
Either Way I Didnt See Them Again That Night
And A Couple [[Branches/People\|People]] Loved "My" Hello Kitty Hoodie 

The Venue Was Warm (More About That Later) We Got Near The Front But To The Side Pretty Early On And Kinda Stayed There

There Were Two Supporting Acts Because This Concert Was Scheduled For Hours And I Think Lovejoy Only Has One Hours Worth Of Music
The First Supporting Band Was Called Loupe And They Were Pretty Cool But Not Like Mind Blowing
the Second Support Was Good Kid Who Were Amazing
I Loved Their Energy: Really Got The Crowd Going And I Looked Them Up After The Concert
They Sang Songs About Witches Bitches And Anime My Favourite Two From The Concert Were Mimis Delivery Service And Madeline (Both About Women (Two Seperate Women)) Which Were Super Vibey And I Know The Words To The Latter Song

Lovejoy Came Out And Everyone Screamed (Low-Key Shocked That I Could Still Hear After Each Scream (Of Which There Were Possibly Dozens))
Oh Yeah At One Point There Was A Group Of Kids Stacking Plastic Cups And It Went Super High
Anyway Lovejoy Came On, Wilbur Soot Took Centre Mic And Said "Uh Hello" (Each Pause Had A Bunch Of Loud Screams After It) "We're A Band Called Lovejoy.... And We Were Hoping To Perform Some Songs For You Tonight..I Hope Thats [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] With You Guys" 
The First Song They Sang Was Perfume Which Was Introduced As "A Song About Not Knowing What Love Is....Or A Type Of Cologne I Guess" Which Is So Their Vibe
They Also Performed Songs About "A Prime Minister We Had Once", "A Man Whos A Left Leaning Gentleman And His Wife Who Is Married To A Left Leaning Gentleman But She Sneaks Out At Night To Sleep With You So You Blackmail Her Saying Ill Tell Your Husband If You Dont Give [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] All Your Money Which We've All Been Through. Im Sure, Im Sure Its A Very Common Experience Shared By Everyone In This Room", And "Consequences" (Wilbur Wasnt A Fan Of That Introduction)
And Every Time They Ended A Song By Like Dying
Like A Standing Ragdoll With All The Lights Turning Off For A Second
The Lights Were Fantastic! Whoever Was In Charge Of The Lighting Effects Deserves A Raise

It Was Really Hot
I Didnt Feel It That Much But There Was A Constant Increase In [[Branches/People\|People]] Passing Out Throughout The Concert
so We Had To Keep Stopping The Concert To Make Sure That Whoever Passed Out Doesnt Just Die In The Middle Of The Concert
There Was Water That Was Being Handed Out But Wilbur Told The Bar To Also Keep Handing Out Water For The Rest Of The Night
Because [[Branches/People\|People]] Kept Fucking Dying Lovejoy Left The Stage Dfor A Bit So That [[Branches/People\|People]] Felt Less Pressure To Be Super Hyped An Energetic In The Middle Of The Crowd And Thus More Encouraged To Walk To The Back Of The Room And Get Drinks Or Step Outside So That They Can Breathe
All In All Though I Dont Think The Bodies Made The Concert Any Worse
Everytime I Saw Someone Leave The Crowd I Felt The Room Get Colder
Human [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body]] Temperature Is Such A Weird Concept

Dan Got A Black And White Poster That I Ended Up Accidentally Stealing Which Is Kinda Funny

I Should Go To More Concerts
