Oh, the grand old Duke of York,  
He had ten thousand men,  
He marched them up to the top of the hill  
And he marched them down again.

And when they were up they were up,  
And when they were down they were down,  
And when they were only half way up  
They were neither up nor down.

They all marched up to the top of the hill,  
With a hup, two, three, four, drilling their drill.

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,

To fetch a pail of water

Went to bed  
To mend his head  
With vinegar and brown paper.

Half a pound of tuppenny rice  
Half a pound of treacle  
That’s the way the money goes  
POP! goes the weasel.

A penny for a spool of thread  
A penny for a needle  
That’s the way the money goes

The badger chased the weasel  
They ran and ran and had great fun  
POP! goes the weasel.

Up and down the city road  
In and out of the steeple  
Round the town and back again  
POP! goes the weasel.

Half a pound of tuppenny rice  
Half a pound of treacle  
That’s the way the way the money goes  
POP! goes the weasel.

A sailor went to sea, sea, sea

To see what he could see, see, see.

But all that he could see, see, see

Was the bottom of the deep blue sea, sea, sea.

While saying "sea", aquatic waves are mimed with the hand; while saying "see", the hand is brought to the eye to mime a "seeing" gesture.

Further verses typically replace "sea/see" with other words, such as "chop", "knee", "bed", or "pick", "toes", with appropriate gestural substitutions
