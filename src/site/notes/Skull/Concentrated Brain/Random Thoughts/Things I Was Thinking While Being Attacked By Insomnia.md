# I Was Tired
The Reason The Romans Persecuted Early Christians Was Because They Believed Them To Be Cannibals
Most People Assumed It Was Because Of Confusion Surrounding The Whole Blood And Body Of Christ Consumption And It Being Literal
However
Octavius Of Minucius Felix Or (Something) Sited All Sorts Of Accusations Including Initiation Rites That Involved Murdering Of Infants And Drinking Their Blood
