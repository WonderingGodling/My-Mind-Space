I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters 
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country 
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc) 
But Its Still Horrendous 
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research 
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both 
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Back To Random

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Vie\|Vie]]
We Need To Talk More

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation 
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Branches/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves 
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful

## Sneaky Imports

https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf](https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf) I Was Thinking About A Video Like This Last Nigh

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I 
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun? 
Neither Does Breathing 
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

[[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|My Friend]] Threatened To Wear A "Lil Black Skirt" And If They Do I'll Strangle Them /Affectionate

Very Few Things Bring [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Happiness 
And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours 
Happiness Is A Lie 
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering 
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] On This Train 
My Book And Headphones Are In My Bag And Getting Either Will Take Way More Energy Than I Have

Not Everyones As Dried Apricots As They Think They Are

ETA: Fact

Woke Up At Like 2100 Spent Three Hours Eating And Now Im Just Existing At 1


**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**


Went To Bed At Like Six Last Night (For Eight Hours) 
Best Sleep Of Like A Month

I Think Most [[Branches/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept 
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For 
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again" 
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy 
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason 
I Have Mcdonalds; Why Would I Want Mcdonalds To Taste Good 
I Dont Know What My Subconscious Is Up To 
Theres Cayenne In My Pocket

Mmmm 
Markiplier Isnt Cheering [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Up And I Dont Feel Like Music Right Now

I Used The Peppers 
Good Job [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Mark Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Laugh 
We Got Spooked Together <3

## More Imports

Wearing My Friends Shirt And On My Way To Town They Said They Were Getting The Train In So We Should Meet Up 
They Didnt Notice I Was Wearing Her Shirt Until I Pointed It Out Smh

Just Read A Yuri Manga And The More I Read The More I Was Like "This Is Not A Healthy Thing To Read" 
Then It Ended And I Was Just Like "....[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Sure"

I Dont Feel Anything About It 
Cant Decide If It Was a Happy Ending Or What

I Just Saw A Steam Comment "Homestuck? Well Yeah Its Bolted To The Ground"

Nonbinary Dom Like 
"My Pronouns Are Master/Master's; You Will Adress [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Your Knees"

Remember [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Making Fun Of The Armpit Guy Because "How The Ft Dod He Figure That Out‽" 
Ive Changed My Opinion 

I Dont Know If This Video Is Safe For Work But Its Relevant So Probably Not (ETA(19·2023 47.08) The Video I Put Here Dissapeared But It Was In Fact Proof That Armpit Focused Videos Exist)

Did Yall Know You Can Group Call On The Lovesense App?

I Think If A Guy Gets A Girl Pregnant She Should Just Be Able To Give Him The Pregnancy 
That Would Be A Great Update To Human Biology

I Found Out One Of [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Ash/Tiddy Gremlin\|My Friends]] Is Into Rope Bondage 
He Doesn't Live In England 
Most Of The [[Branches/People\|People]] Begging To Be Roped Live Way Too Far Or Are Way Too Busy

Somebody (Not Naming Names) Has Put Tablespoons Of Tea Into My Teapot Instead Of The More Elegant And Aptly Named Teaspoons Of Tea So I Dont Think The Brew Strength Is Ever Right

Someone Should Make An Algorithm That Analyses The Frames Of Tv Shows And Switches Between Episodes Smoothly
Like Youre Watching Friends Season Three And In Season Seven Episode Nine Everyone Happens To Stand In The Same Place So Its Suddenly Just A Whole Different Episode From Now On

I Wanted Tea
I Cant Go Downstairs Though Because My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Wendy\|Mother]]'s Lurking Around

I Dont Wanna Hear Christmas Music
I Cannot Stand Christmas Music
Most Christmas Songs Are Ear Grating But They Get A Pass Because Theyre About Christmas 
Thats Not How Songs Work!
Write A Good Song **Then** I'll Hope It Comes On The Radio
Nobodys Walking Over To A Jukebox And Playing Do They Know Its Christmas

Eating Breakfast Out Of A Mug

Saw Cor's Family This Morning

Past Them And Recognised Their Voices
It Was Quite A Pleasant Surprise

I Thought It Was Just Really Loud Bird Shit, Then Noticed It Was Too Big
Theres Nobody Near [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Throw It....

Ive Thought Barely Anything Today
/̵͇̿̿/'̿'̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ 

Recently Ive Felt So Little About So Much
Thats Why I Haven't Been Adding Anything 
Christmas Is Coming Around Which Is Fun!
I Have Literally No Expectations Whatsoever So I Cant Really Be Let Down I Guess

I Feel Like Utter And Complete Shit
I Want To Drink A Monster Because That Usually Helps But Then Theres Just Gonna Be More Of....This

I Think The Worst Part About Being Raped To Death Is That while Your Name, Face And Family Are All Across The News There Will Be countless Police Officers, Investigators/Detectives, Forensics, Mortuars and So Many Other Pepole Poking Around You Insides Like; Really? This Is So Not The Time For That! I Think Id Least Want [[Branches/People\|People]] Touching My Dead [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] If The Cause Of My Death Was Someone Touching My Live [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]]

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I 
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun?

So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy

## The Top

I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters 
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet 
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired 
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

### Original Random Bulk

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie 
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout? 
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] 
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Party Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Comedy Show Im Going To Instead

ETA: I Did Show Up To The End, Saw Some Old Friends

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country 
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc) 
But Its Still Horrendous 
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research 
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both 
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Back To Random

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Vie\|Vie]]
We Need To Talk More

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation 
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Branches/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves 
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

### Randomness :3

I Did A Bit Of Tidying Up 
You Wont Notice

## This Is Imported

I Dont Get This Library 
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything 
So You Have To Be A Student To Read 
The Chemistry Is By Textiles 
The Psychology Is Above Renewable Energy 
And It Seems To Be Alphabetical Within The Subject? 
I Got To My Class And There Already [[Branches/People\|People]] There (ETA: Not My [[Branches/People\|People]] Other [[Branches/People\|People]])

First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two 
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination 
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

### Public Transport Rant (Train Edition)

The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im NeveR Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks 
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool 
Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train 
I Know All This Its All Goo 
The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed 
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like • _ • 
Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know 
Thats The Train I Got On

Just Diagnosed Someone With Autism And They Were Like "....Yep"

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data 
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Thoughts]], None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation 
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful 
Its Tuesday 
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void 
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

## Sneaky Imports

https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf](https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf) I Was Thinking About A Video Like This Last Nigh

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I 
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun? 
Neither Does Breathing 
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

[[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|My Friend]] Threatened To Wear A "Lil Black Skirt" And If They Do I'll Strangle Them /Affectionate

Very Few Things Bring [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Happiness 
And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours 
Happiness Is A Lie 
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering 
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] On This Train 
My Book And Headphones Are In My Bag And Getting Either Will Take Way More Energy Than I Have

**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**


Went To Bed At Like Six Last Night (For Eight Hours) 
Best Sleep Of Like A Month

I Think Most [[Branches/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept 
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For 
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again" 
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy 
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason 
I Have Mcdonalds; Why Would I Want Mcdonalds To Taste Good 
I Dont Know What My Subconscious Is Up To

They Didnt Notice I Was Wearing Her Shirt Until I Pointed It Out Smh

Just Read A Yuri Manga And The More I Read The More I Was Like "This Is Not A Healthy Thing To Read" 
Then It Ended And I Was Just Like "....[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Sure"

I Dont Feel Anything About It 
Cant Decide If It Was a Happy Ending Or What

I Just Saw A Steam Comment "Homestuck? Well Yeah Its Bolted To The Ground"

Nonbinary Dom Like 
"My Pronouns Are Master/Master's; You Will Adress [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Your Knees"

Remember [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Making Fun Of The Armpit Guy Because "How The Ft Dod He Figure That Out‽" 
Ive Changed My Opinion 

I Dont Know If This Video Is Safe For Work But Its Relevant So Probably Not (ETA(19·2023 47.08) The Video I Put Here Dissapeared But It Was In Fact Proof That Armpit Focused Videos Exist)

Did Yall Know You Can Group Call On The Lovesense App?

Somebody (Not Naming Names) Has Put Tablespoons Of Tea Into My Teapot Instead Of The More Elegant And Aptly Named Teaspoons Of Tea So I Dont Think The Brew Strength Is Ever Right

Someone Should Make An Algorithm That Analyses The Frames Of Tv Shows And Switches Between Episodes Smoothly
Like Youre Watching Friends Season Three And In Season Seven Episode Nine Everyone Happens To Stand In The Same Place So Its Suddenly Just A Whole Different Episode From Now On

I Wanted Tea

I Want To Drink A Monster Because That Usually Helps But Then Theres Just Gonna Be More Of....This

Dont Worry About It

[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Cool; Looks Like It Works

There Is [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] I Wanna Eat In This Whole City! 
Im Gonna Starve And Im Gonna Laugh

## Secondary Phase Of Random

Interesting: I Can Boot Multiple Instances Of This Application Which (Since Its Locked) Means That I Cant Close Any Instances Of It

I Went Back And Added Some Stuff I Said To My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Moirail\|Moirail]]

Just Diagnosed Someone With Autism And They Were Like "....Yep"

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data 
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Thoughts]], None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation 
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful 
Its Tuesday 
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void 
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

## Sneaky Imports

https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf](https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf) I Was Thinking About A Video Like This Last Nigh

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I 
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun? 
Neither Does Breathing 
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

[[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|My Friend]] Threatened To Wear A "Lil Black Skirt" And If They Do I'll Strangle Them /Affectionate

Very Few Things Bring [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Happiness 
And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours 
Happiness Is A Lie 
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering 
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] On This Train 
My Book And Headphones Are In My Bag And Getting Either Will Take Way More Energy Than I Have

Not Everyones As Dried Apricots As They Think They Are

ETA: Fact

Woke Up At Like 2100 Spent Three Hours Eating And Now Im Just Existing At 1


**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**


Went To Bed At Like Six Last Night (For Eight Hours) 
Best Sleep Of Like A Month

I Think Most [[Branches/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept 
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For 
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again" 
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy 
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason 
I Have Mcdonalds; Why Would I Want Mcdonalds To Taste Good 
I Dont Know What My Subconscious Is Up To 
Theres Cayenne In My Pocket

Mmmm 
Markiplier Isnt Cheering [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Up And I Dont Feel Like Music Right Now

I Used The Peppers 
Good Job [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Mark Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Laugh 
We Got Spooked Together <3

Fuck I Dont Update This Enough 
More Imports:

## More Imports

Wearing My Friends Shirt And On My Way To Town They Said They Were Getting The Train In So We Should Meet Up 
They Didnt Notice I Was Wearing Her Shirt Until I Pointed It Out Smh

Just Read A Yuri Manga And The More I Read The More I Was Like "This Is Not A Healthy Thing To Read" 
Then It Ended And I Was Just Like "....[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Sure"

I Dont Feel Anything About It 
Cant Decide If It Was a Happy Ending Or What

I Just Saw A Steam Comment "Homestuck? Well Yeah Its Bolted To The Ground"

Nonbinary Dom Like 
"My Pronouns Are Master/Master's; You Will Adress [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Your Knees"

Remember [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Making Fun Of The Armpit Guy Because "How The Ft Dod He Figure That Out‽" 
Ive Changed My Opinion 

I Dont Know If This Video Is Safe For Work But Its Relevant So Probably Not (ETA(19·2023 47.08) The Video I Put Here Dissapeared But It Was In Fact Proof That Armpit Focused Videos Exist)

Did Yall Know You Can Group Call On The Lovesense App?

I Think If A Guy Gets A Girl Pregnant She Should Just Be Able To Give Him The Pregnancy 
That Would Be A Great Update To Human Biology

I Found Out One Of [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Ash/Tiddy Gremlin\|My Friends]] Is Into Rope Bondage

Most Of The [[Branches/People\|People]] Begging To Be Roped Live Way Too Far Or Are Way Too Busy

Did Some Messing Around And I Should Be Able To Edit Tje Websote On The Go So....
Expect More Of [[Branches/Me\|Me]] I Guess

Somebody (Not Naming Names) Has Put Tablespoons Of Tea Into My Teapot Instead Of The More Elegant And Aptly Named Teaspoons Of Tea So I Dont Think The Brew Strength Is Ever Right

Someone Should Make An Algorithm That Analyses The Frames Of Tv Shows And Switches Between Episodes Smoothly
Like Youre Watching Friends Season Three And In Season Seven Episode Nine Everyone Happens To Stand In The Same Place So Its Suddenly Just A Whole Different Episode From Now On

I Wanted Tea
I Cant Go Downstairs Though Because My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Wendy\|Mother]]'s Lurking Around

I Dont Wanna Hear Christmas Music
I Cannot Stand Christmas Music
Most Christmas Songs Are Ear Grating But They Get A Pass Because Theyre About Christmas 
Thats Not How Songs Work!
Write A Good Song **Then** I'll Hope It Comes On The Radio
Nobodys Walking Over To A Jukebox And Playing Do They Know Its Christmas 
You Know What They Are Playing?
Africa
Essentially About The Same Thing Except Ones Shit And Mentions Christmas In The Chorus

This CD Im Looking At Has 2000 Miles On It
Thzts Not A Christmas Song?
Ave Maria‽
Does Jesus Song Just Mean Christmas Song?
OVER THE RAINBOW
Why Do We Bother

Im Trying To Cook But My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Is A Few Actions Before My Brain So I Haven't Technically Started 

Eating Breakfast Out Of A Mug

Saw Cor's Family This Morning
Bus Isnt Showing Up So Im Walking Down
Past Them And Recognised Their Voices
It Was Quite A Pleasant Surprise 

A Pancake Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] Just Fell From The Sky?
Like [[Plap.jpg\|Plap!]]
I Thought It Was Just Really Loud Bird Shit, Then Noticed It Was Too Big
Theres Nobody Near [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Throw It....

Ive Thought Barely Anything Today
/̵͇̿̿/'̿'̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ 

Recently Ive Felt So Little About So Much
Thats Why I Haven't Been Adding Anything 
Christmas Is Coming Around Which Is Fun!
I Have Literally No Expectations Whatsoever So I Cant Really Be Let Down I Guess

I Feel Like Utter And Complete Shit
I Want To Drink A Monster Because That Usually Helps But Then Theres Just Gonna Be More Of....This

I Think The Worst Part About Being Raped To Death Is That while Your Name, Face And Family Are All Across The News There Will Be countless Police Officers, Investigators/Detectives, Forensics, Mortuars and So Many Other Pepole Poking Around You Insides Like; Really? This Is So Not The Time For That! I Think Id Least Want [[Branches/People\|People]] Touching My Dead [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] If The Cause Of My Death Was Someone Touching My Live [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]]

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons

I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|MagNus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching Hazbin Hotel But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 


Mortician Boyfriend Who Puts Ice In Your Mouth So He Can Imagine Getting Blown Off By A Corpse
Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Branches/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

I'll add it to a wish list so I don't need this track of it. I need to follow a bunch of games on here. Good Morning.

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once


## Stardew Jammables
### Spring
Strawberry
kAle
Rhubarb
Cauliflower
### Summer
Starfruit
Hops
Red Cabbage

### Fall

There Are Many Pages Here Which Are Intended To Actually Be Completely Empty
This Is The Longest Of Those

Dnd Food Item: Maybe Bell

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

Going To Bed Sad Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A Dnd Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A Dnd Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If Vie Doesnt Hate Me, Id Love To See How She Talks To The People He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For Me To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At Me Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of Me
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating Me, Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To Me But Still Kinda Hates The Rest Of My Existance) And A Few Other People Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did WholehEartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.

Also Im Now A Light Player And I Think [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is One Of The Desolation Maybe; Who Knows

![IMG-20240114-WA0016 1.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0016%201.jpg)![IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg)
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons


Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)

Speech To Text Making An Appearance 

Finally Got My Hands On A Copy Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|House Of Leaves]]
Its A Second Editioni Copy Publishd In 2001 

Count Bin Face Is Active Again


I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|MagNus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching Hazbin Hotel But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Wanna Put Together A Dnd Party Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Arent Friends; Mainly To See How Player Chemistry Would Form From Scratch Or If It Even Will
Itll Be Interesting To See If Two [[Branches/People\|People]] Hate Each Other Do They Reflect That In-Game Or Vice Versa

My Computer Now Starts With A Key

Also I Went To Las Iguanas To Eat, It Was Pretty Good

Oh And New Earphones Are Quite Good
Makes [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Feel A Little [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|Crazy]] Though Because I Feel Like Im Listening To Shit In A Silewnt Room And Everyones Just Like "Who The Fuack Is This Guy?"
Im Not Worried Theyre Judgin G [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Its Just A Very Large Tonal Shift

Watch Icp Win US Presidency

Cleaning Up The Vault

I Always Feel Like I Shouldnt Be In This [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] But Recently Ive Felt That My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Doesn't Belong With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] In It

<div class="tumblr-post" data-href="https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/t:0WVvjWYXyV_tcp5kf631Jw/729147951762505728/v2" data-did="945d63eecd58b6a0bd44d5f12bb9abce89656c19" ><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/shencomix/739174739386515456">https://www.tumblr.com/shencomix/739174739386515456</a></div><script async src="https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js?_v=38df9a6ca7436e6ca1b851b0543b9f51"></script>


I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 


Mortician Boyfriend Who Puts Ice In Your Mouth So He Can Imagine Getting Blown Off By A Corpse
Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Branches/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube 
L

Aaaaaaaaa

I keep forgetting I Have This

If I cant Sleep Im actually Gonna Be Really Mad :)

Really Enjoying This Season For Some Reason

4k Zen Comp Play; 2nd Supp Comp Play In Half As Many Hours 
Going To Bed

52•2024•0359 Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Going To Bed Early So That Im Fully Rested For Dee <s>Tomorrow</s> Today 
Also Listening To [[Branches/TMA\|TMA]] 99 Dust To Dust; Its A Gertrude Episode (Not Her Best Though)

Also, [[Branches/Me\|Me]], Its Boise City Oklahoma
You Always Forget That Settlement--
What The Gell Is My Tinnitus Doing Today Its Bloody Distracting 

Holy Hell! Today Was So Awesome!! 52•2024• 
I Got To Hang Out With Dee Like All Day-- 

I Just love Dee So Much

Also [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is Cool, Glad Theyre Safe And All That

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

But Also You Could Add Wrighth To Glasses Or Something To Make The Invisible Wrighth Vidible 

So To Combat That You Add Wrighth To The Original Thing That Says Thag If Someone Uses The Read Invisible Wrighth Glasses Then Its Still Invisible

Celebrated A Family Members Birthday In June
It Was Scheduled For 1300 We Showed Up At 1500 And Prople Only Started Showing Up Like Five Minutes Later So I Guess We All Just Said "Nahh" Anyway

I'm going to look at steam games for a bit. See, if there's any alright, why? Because I'm bored. Also, it's not picking up Dublin sonic, do a waste word.

Response Douglas, I said douglas douglas. Not Dublin sonic, do a waste word. Does the game called see if mutation that came out today, it doesn't look Bad. I don't know if it looks good. I'll add it to a wish list so I don't need this track of it. I need to follow a bunch of games on here. Good Morning.

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once


## Stardew Jammables
### Spring
Strawberry
kAle
Rhubarb
Cauliflower
### Summer
Starfruit
Hops
Red Cabbage
Melon
Radish
Pineapple
Tarot Root
### Fall
Pumpkin
GRape
Artichoke
Beet
Amoranth
Yam
Cranberry

There Are Many Pages Here Which Are Intended To Actually Be Completely Empty
This Is The Longest Of Those

Dnd Food Item: Maybe Bell

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

Going To Bed Sad Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A Dnd Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A Dnd Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If Vie Doesnt Hate Me, Id Love To See How She Talks To The People He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For Me To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At Me Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of Me
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating Me, Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To Me But Still Kinda Hates The Rest Of My Existance) And A Few Other People Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did WholehEartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.

Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons


Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)

Speech To Text Making An Appearance 

Finally Got My Hands On A Copy Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|House Of Leaves]]
Its A Second Editioni Copy Publishd In 2001 

Count Bin Face Is Active Again


I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|MagNus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching Hazbin Hotel But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Wanna Put Together A Dnd Party Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Arent Friends; Mainly To See How Player Chemistry Would Form From Scratch Or If It Even Will
Itll Be Interesting To See If Two [[Branches/People\|People]] Hate Each Other Do They Reflect That In-Game Or Vice Versa

My Computer Now Starts With A Key

Also I Went To Las Iguanas To Eat, It Was Pretty Good

Oh And New Earphones Are Quite Good
Makes [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Feel A Little [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|Crazy]] Though Because I Feel Like Im Listening To Shit In A Silewnt Room And Everyones Just Like "Who The Fuack Is This Guy?"
Im Not Worried Theyre Judgin G [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Its Just A Very Large Tonal Shift

Watch Icp Win US Presidency

Cleaning Up The Vault

I Always Feel Like I Shouldnt Be In This [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] But Recently Ive Felt That My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Doesn't Belong With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] In It

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 


Mortician Boyfriend Who Puts Ice In Your Mouth So He Can Imagine Getting Blown Off By A Corpse
Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Branches/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

Like Its Not The Top Of My To-Do List But At The Same Time The Rest Of That List Doesnt Feel More Entertaining At The Moment

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

Holy Hell I Forgot; Pay Attention!

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once

There Are Many Pages Here Which Are Intended To Actually Be Completely Empty
This Is The Longest Of Those

Dnd Food Item: Maybe Bell

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

Going To Bed Sad Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A Dnd Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A Dnd Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If Vie Doesnt Hate Me, Id Love To See How She Talks To The People He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For Me To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At Me Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of Me
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating Me, Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To Me But Still Kinda Hates The Rest Of My Existance) And A Few Other People Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did WholehEartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.

Also Im Now A Light Player And I Think [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is One Of The Desolation Maybe; Who Knows

![IMG-20240114-WA0016 1.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0016%201.jpg)![IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg)
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons


Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)

Speech To Text Making An Appearance 

Finally Got My Hands On A Copy Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|House Of Leaves]]
Its A Second Editioni Copy Publishd In 2001 

Count Bin Face Is Active Again


I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|MagNus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching Hazbin Hotel But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Wanna Put Together A Dnd Party Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Arent Friends; Mainly To See How Player Chemistry Would Form From Scratch Or If It Even Will
Itll Be Interesting To See If Two [[Branches/People\|People]] Hate Each Other Do They Reflect That In-Game Or Vice Versa

My Computer Now Starts With A Key

Also I Went To Las Iguanas To Eat, It Was Pretty Good

Oh And New Earphones Are Quite Good
Makes [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Feel A Little [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|Crazy]] Though Because I Feel Like Im Listening To Shit In A Silewnt Room And Everyones Just Like "Who The Fuack Is This Guy?"
Im Not Worried Theyre Judgin G [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Its Just A Very Large Tonal Shift

Watch Icp Win US Presidency

Cleaning Up The Vault

I Always Feel Like I Shouldnt Be In This [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] But Recently Ive Felt That My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Doesn't Belong With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] In It

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 


Mortician Boyfriend Who Puts Ice In Your Mouth So He Can Imagine Getting Blown Off By A Corpse
Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Branches/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

Aaaaaaaaa

I keep forgetting I Have This

If I cant Sleep Im actually Gonna Be Really Mad :)

Really Enjoying This Season For Some Reason

4k Zen Comp Play; 2nd Supp Comp Play In Half As Many Hours 
Going To Bed

52•2024•0359 Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Going To Bed Early So That Im Fully Rested For Dee <s>Tomorrow</s> Today 
Also Listening To [[Branches/TMA\|TMA]] 99 Dust To Dust; Its A Gertrude Episode (Not Her Best Though)

Also, [[Branches/Me\|Me]], Its Boise City Oklahoma
You Always Forget That Settlement--
What The Gell Is My Tinnitus Doing Today Its Bloody Distracting 

Holy Hell! Today Was So Awesome!! 52•2024• 
I Got To Hang Out With Dee Like All Day-- 

I Just love Dee So Much

Also [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is Cool, Glad Theyre Safe And All That

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

But Also You Could Add Wrighth To Glasses Or Something To Make The Invisible Wrighth Vidible

Like The Game Didnt Open But The "Started Playing" Notification Sent

Celebrated A Family Members Birthday In June
It Was Scheduled For 1300 We Showed Up At 1500 And Prople Only Started Showing Up Like Five Minutes Later So I Guess We All Just Said "Nahh" Anyway

I'm going to look at steam games for a bit. See, if there's any alright, why? Because I'm bored. Also, it's not picking up Dublin sonic, do a waste word.

Response Douglas, I said douglas douglas. Not Dublin sonic, do a waste word. Does the game called see if mutation that came out today, it doesn't look Bad. I don't know if it looks good. I'll add it to a wish list so I don't need this track of it. I need to follow a bunch of games on here. Good Morning.

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once


## Stardew Jammables
### Spring
Strawberry
kAle
Rhubarb
Cauliflower
### Summer
Starfruit
Hops
Red Cabbage
Melon
Radish
Pineapple
Tarot Root
### Fall
Pumpkin
GRape
Artichoke
Beet
Amoranth
Yam
Cranberry

There Are Many Pages Here Which Are Intended To Actually Be Completely Empty
This Is The Longest Of Those

Dnd Food Item: Maybe Bell

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

Going To Bed Sad Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A Dnd Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A Dnd Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If Vie Doesnt Hate Me, Id Love To See How She Talks To The People He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For Me To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At Me Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of Me
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating Me, Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To Me But Still Kinda Hates The Rest Of My Existance) And A Few Other People Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did WholehEartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.

Also Im Now A Light Player And I Think [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is One Of The Desolation Maybe; Who Knows

![IMG-20240114-WA0016 1.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0016%201.jpg)![IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg)
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons


Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)

Speech To Text Making An Appearance 

Finally Got My Hands On A Copy Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|House Of Leaves]]
Its A Second Editioni Copy Publishd In 2001 

Count Bin Face Is Active Again


I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|MagNus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching Hazbin Hotel But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Wanna Put Together A Dnd Party Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Arent Friends; Mainly To See How Player Chemistry Would Form From Scratch Or If It Even Will
Itll Be Interesting To See If Two [[Branches/People\|People]] Hate Each Other Do They Reflect That In-Game Or Vice Versa

My Computer Now Starts With A Key

Also I Went To Las Iguanas To Eat, It Was Pretty Good

Oh And New Earphones Are Quite Good
Makes [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Feel A Little [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|Crazy]] Though Because I Feel Like Im Listening To Shit In A Silewnt Room And Everyones Just Like "Who The Fuack Is This Guy?"
Im Not Worried Theyre Judgin G [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Its Just A Very Large Tonal Shift

Watch Icp Win US Presidency

Cleaning Up The Vault

I Always Feel Like I Shouldnt Be In This [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] But Recently Ive Felt That My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Doesn't Belong With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] In It

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 


Mortician Boyfriend Who Puts Ice In Your Mouth So He Can Imagine Getting Blown Off By A Corpse
Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Branches/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

~Markiplier In Awe

Lowkey Wanna Go Down On Someone Rn
Need [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Do And Brains Like "Someone Works Too ;)"
Like Its Not The Top Of My To-Do List But At The Same Time The Rest Of That List Doesnt Feel More Entertaining At The Moment

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

Holy Hell I Forgot; Pay Attention!
I Found Arizona Iced Tea Across The Road From My Uni; The Real Deal And Everything So I Bought A Couple (saving Them Because They Were Expensive) Im Just Happy That They Really Exist

I Realised That When You Write Wizard Maths To Make (Oh Yeah I Named It) The Wrighth (Like Write) Invisible You Can Write Maths By It
But If You Wrote A Wrighth Next To It To Turn The Maths Invisible Then The Maths Would Also Turn The Invisibility Wrighth Invisible
But Also You Could Add Wrighth To Glasses Or Something To Make The Invisible Wrighth Vidible 

So To Combat That You Add Wrighth To The Original Thing That Says Thag If Someone Uses The Read Invisible Wrighth Glasses Then Its Still Invisible

Reminder To Do Research On Stuffs Ive Written Down
And Animal Facts
And Actually Im Gonna Make A To-do List
done

[this Bit Has Been Moved Over To [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/StT Killing Me\|StT Killing Me]]]
I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once


## Stardew Jammables
### Spring
Strawberry
kAle
Rhubarb
Cauliflower
### Summer
Starfruit
Hops
Red Cabbage
Melon
Radish
Pineapple
Tarot Root
### Fall
Pumpkin
GRape
Artichoke
Beet
Amoranth
Yam
Cranberry

There Are Many Pages Here Which Are Intended To Actually Be Completely Empty
This Is The Longest Of Those

Dnd Food Item: Maybe Bell

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

Going To Bed Sad Because What I Want To Do Is Play Bg3 But I Jjust Came Out Of A Dnd Sesh Where Everyone Kinda Feels Shitty So I Feel Like It Would Be In Pour Tase To Fuck Off And-- 
It Would Be In *Poor Taste* To Fuck Off And Then Play A Dnd Inspired Videogame Until The Sun Comes Up

Also If Vie Doesnt Hate Me, Id Love To See How She Talks To The People He Does Hate Because I Am Dying Every Day Out Here And I Feel Like Theyre Praying For Me To Become A Better Person, But, Everytime They Look At Me Im Just More Of A Wretched Facade Of Human Emotions, Slowly Crumbling Into The Nothingness That Radiates Out Of Me
And Im Stuck Like This.

I Mean It Doesnt Help That I Feel Like Everyone Else Is Barely Tollerating Me, Except My Cow (Who Does Seem To Genuinely Enjoy Talking To Me But Still Kinda Hates The Rest Of My Existance) And A Few Other People Who I Feel Like Theyre Just Indifferent
Who Can Blame Them Though
Should Change My Name To Marmite
Or Just Kill Myself (A Very Funny Joke) To Get Out Of Everyones Way

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did WholehEartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.
