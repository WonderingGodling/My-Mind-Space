I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters  
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet  
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired  
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

### Original Random Bulk

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie  
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout?  
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]  
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Party Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Comedy Show Im Going To Instead

ETA: I Did Show Up To The End, Saw Some Old Friends

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country  
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc)  
But Its Still Horrendous  
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research  
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both  
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Back To Random

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunshine]]
We Need To Talk More

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation  
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves  
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

### Randomness :3

I Did A Bit Of Tidying Up  
You Wont Notice

## This Is Imported

I Dont Get This Library  
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything  
So You Have To Be A Student To Read  
The Chemistry Is By Textiles  
The Psychology Is Above Renewable Energy  
And It Seems To Be Alphabetical Within The Subject?  
I Got To My Class And There Already [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] There

First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two  
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination  
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

### Public Transport Rant (Train Edition)

The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im NeveR Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks  
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool  
Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train  
I Know All This Its All Goo  
The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed  
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like • _ •  
Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know  
Thats The Train I Got On

### We Imported Still

The Library Is Dewey Decimal  
The Catagory Arangement Still Feels Arbitrary

Testing A Thing  
Dont Worry About It

[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Cool; Looks Like It Works

What Even Is "Good Food"

## Secondary Phase Of Random

Interesting: I Can Boot Multiple Instances Of This Application Which (Since Its Locked) Means That I Cant Close Any Instances Of It

I Went Back And Added Some Stuff I Said To My [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunshine]]

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data  
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many Thoughts, None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation  
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42 2023) Has Been Stressful

Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void  
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

## Sneaky Imports

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish  
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That  
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific  
I Figured It Out!  
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages  
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits"  
Then You Go Home And Figure It Out From There  
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This"  
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing  
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I  
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours  
That Doesn't Sound Fun?  
Neither Does Breathing  
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel  
And I Feel [[]Nothing\|]Nothing]]

My Friend Threatened To Wear A "Lil Black Skirt" And If They Do I'll Strangle Them /Affectionate

Very Few Things Bring [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Happiness  
And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours  
Happiness Is A Lie  
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering  
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]On This Train

Woke Up At Like 2100 Spent Three Hours Eating And Now Im Just Existing At 1

Just Walked Passed A Homeless Guy With a Cat Which Is Honestly Genuis  
His Cat Was This Absolutely Adorable Little Bicolour And Of Course Nobody wants Them To Starve Or Anything So Give The Man Some Money So The Kitty Can Be Happy!

**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**

Theres A Person In Front Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Who Has A Bright Pink Backpack And Is Standing Next To Someone Whos Jumper Is That Exact Shade Of Pink

I Think Most [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept  
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For  
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again"  
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya  
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy  
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

Theres One Scene In Particular Thats Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Where The Mother Addresses The Girl As "Brandy" To Which She Replies "Thats The Dog Mom...."  
The Reason Its Always Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Is Because Thats How I Feel Every Time I Have A Conversation With My Mother  
I Know Shes Not Listening And That I Have - And Will Have To - Repeat Whatever I Just Said To Someone Who Ultimately Doesnt Care One Way Or The Other

Fuck I Dont Update This Enough

Cant Decide If It Was a Happy Ending Or What

I Just Saw A Steam Comment "Homestuck? Well Yeah Its Bolted To The Ground"

Nonbinary Dom Like  
"My Pronouns Are Master/Master's; You Will Adress [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] On Your Knees"
