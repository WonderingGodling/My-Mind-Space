# <span style="color:#CD0000">Constant Comment (Not The Tea)</span>
I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout?
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Partyh Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Omedy Show Im Going To Instead

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc)
But Its Still Horrendous
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunshine]]
We Need To Talk More 

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

I Did A Bit Of Tidying Up
You Wont Notice

 I Don Get This Library
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything
 So You Have To Be A Student To Read
The Chemistry Is By Textiles 
The Psychology Is Above Renewable Energy
 And It Seems To Be Alphabetical Within The Subject?
I Got To My Class And There Already People There

 First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

 The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im Nevee Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool
 Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train 
I Know All This Its All Goo
 The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like •_•
 Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know 
Thats The Train I Got On

The Library Is Dewey Decimal 
The Catagory Arangement Still Feels Arbitrary

Testing A Thing
Dont Worry About It

Okay Cool; Looks Like It Works

There Is Nothing I Wanna Eat In This Whole City!
Im Gonna Starve And Im Gonna Laugh 
(I'll Probably Eat In Town But Still)
What Even Is "Good Food"

Interesting: I Can Boot Multiple Instances Of This Application Which (Since Its Locked) Means That I Cant Close Any Instances Of It

I Went Back And Added Some Stuff I Said To My Sunshine 

Just Diagnosed Someone With Autism And They Were Like "Yep"

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tolorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop 

I Ran Out Of Data
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality 

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many Thoughts, Nond Of Which Carey With Them The Drive For Dictation 
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Donr Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Sectretly <b>Losing My Mind!</b>

"Im Going To Go Watch Big Brother"
"Do You Wanna Hear A [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People Repellant/Human Centipede/Human Centipede\|Human Centipede]] Fact‽‽‽‽"

Today- This Week (42 2023) Has Been Stressful 
Its Tuesday 
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cozy Void
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

Riddle Podcast: The Sculptor Turned Farmer Was In The Sh__ Resulting In A Lovely ___
One Of The Hosts Like Immediately: Ed Sheeran Shape Of You
(In The Shed Shearing And Shape Of Yew)
Idk How She Got That Because I Still Think Its Dumb

https://youtu.be/zHHQusnYY3c?si=fKYYsvFJHomCnpDf I Was Thinking About A Video Like This Last Nigh

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Dearg And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That
I Just Feel Like "Body Part" Is Too Specific
 I Figured It Out!
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits"
Then You Go Home Annd Figure It Out From There
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This"
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?
<p align=right> You should see <p>
I Was Gonna Say "Im Okay" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious
Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus
Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist
But Theres A Few Videos Of People Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi"
So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add
