I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout?
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely Nothing
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Partyh Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Omedy Show Im Going To Instead

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc)
But Its Still Horrendous
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

Also I Miss My Sunshine
We Need To Talk More
