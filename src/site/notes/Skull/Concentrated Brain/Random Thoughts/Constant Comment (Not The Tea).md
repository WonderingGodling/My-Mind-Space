## The Top

I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters 
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet 
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired 
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

### Original Random Bulk

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie 
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Vie\|Vie]]
We Need To Talk More

### Randomness :3

### We Imported Still

The Library Is Dewey Decimal 
The Catagory Arangement Still Feels Arbitrary

Testing A Thing 
Dont Worry About It

[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Cool; Looks Like It Works

There Is [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] I Wanna Eat In This Whole City! 
Im Gonna Starve And Im Gonna Laugh

What Even Is "Good Food"

Interesting: I Can Boot Multiple Instances Of This Application Which (Since Its Locked) Means That I Cant Close Any Instances Of It

I Went Back And Added Some Stuff I Said To My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Moirail\|Moirail]]

Just Diagnosed Someone With Autism And They Were Like "....Yep"

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data 
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]]" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Branches/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I 
Want To Die

## More Imports

Wearing My Friends Shirt And On My Way To Town They Said They Were Getting The Train In So We Should Meet Up 
They Didnt Notice I Was Wearing Her Shirt Until I Pointed It Out Smh

Just Read A Yuri Manga And The More I Read The More I Was Like "This Is Not A Healthy Thing To Read" 
Then It Ended And I Was Just Like "....[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]] Sure"

I Dont Feel Anything About It 
Cant Decide If It Was a Happy Ending Or What

I Just Saw A Steam Comment "Homestuck? Well Yeah Its Bolted To The Ground"

Nonbinary Dom Like 
"My Pronouns Are Master/Master's; You Will Address [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] On Your Knees"

Remember [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Making Fun Of The Armpit Guy Because "How The The Fuck Did He Figure That Out‽" 
Ive Changed My Opinion 

I Dont Know If This Video Is Safe For Work But Its Relevant So Probably Not (ETA(19·2023 47.08) The Video I Put Here Disappeared But It Was In Fact Proof That Armpit Focused Videos Exist)

Did Yall Know You Can Group Call On The Lovesense App?

I Think If A Guy Gets A Girl Pregnant She Should Just Be Able To Give Him The Pregnancy 
That Would Be A Great Update To Human Biology

I Found Out One Of [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Ash/Tiddy Gremlin\|My Friends]] Is Into Rope Bondage 
He Doesn't Live In England 
Most Of The [[Branches/People\|People]] Begging To Be Roped Live Way Too Far Or Are Way Too Busy

Did Some Messing Around And I Should Be Able To Edit The Website On The Go So....
Expect More Of [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] I Guess

Somebody (Not Naming Names) Has Put Tablespoons Of Tea Into My Teapot Instead Of The More Elegant And Aptly Named Teaspoons Of Tea So I Dont Think The Brew Strength Is Ever Right

Someone Should Make An Algorithm That Analyses The Frames Of Tv Shows And Switches Between Episodes Smoothly
Like Youre Watching Friends Season Three And In Season Seven Episode Nine Everyone Happens To Stand In The Same Place So Its Suddenly Just A Whole Different Episode From Now On

Eating Breakfast Out Of A Mug

Saw Cor's Family This Morning
Bus Isnt Showing Up So Im Walking Down
Past Them And Recognised Their Voices
It Was Quite A Pleasant Surprise 

A Pancake Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] Just Fell From The Sky?
Like [[Plap.jpg\|Plap!]] [Plap.jpeg Could Not Be Found?????] 
I Thought It Was Just Really Loud Bird Shit, Then Noticed It Was Too Big

Christmas Is Coming Around Which Is Fun!
I Have Literally No Expectations Whatsoever So I Cant Really Be Let Down I Guess

# Zoochosis

It Has Come To My Attention (Via [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] What I Think Is Best For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]) That Since I Am Undergoing Zoochosis And That The Enrichment Time That I Usually Try To Provide Myself With Is A Failing Method, The Best Thing For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] To Do For My Mental Health Is To Empty The Beehive More Frequently; The Problem Isnt My Mind, It's Keeping My Mind Locked Iniside Of Itself

Also Im Now A Light Player And I Think [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is One Of The Desolation Maybe; Who Knows

![IMG-20240114-WA0016 1.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0016%201.jpg)![IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg](/img/user/images/IMG-20240114-WA0019.jpg)
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I Just Got Dissapointed Because I Mistakenly Thought I Spotted A Free Box Of Floor Tampons

Corys Definitely A Light Player; I Dont Know If Hes A Watcher Though; I Think Hes A Spiral Or Maybe The Web (Do Spiders Need To Manipulate <b>[[Branches/People\|People]]</b> Or Can They Have Fun With It?)

Speech To Text Making An Appearance 

Finally Got My Hands On A Copy Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|House Of Leaves]]
Its A Second Edition Copy Published In 2001 

Count Bin Face Is Active Again

I Wasnt Listening To The New [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/The Magnus Protocol/The Magnnus Protocol\|Magnus Protocol]] Episode Because I Was Freaking Over The Small Details
Technically The First Episode (I Know Two Came Out At Once)

I Was Watching [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/Vivzie/Hazbin Hotel\|Hazbin Hotel]] But I Couldnt Find Episode Five So :)

I Wanna Go On Reality Tv Shows And Just Lie To Everyone, Drive Them Slowly Insane; Every Year Or Two Someone With My Face But A Different Name Shows Up On A New Season Of Some Random Reality Tv Show Or Game Show Or Whatever And Nobody Quite Knows Why

Just Learned That The Rocks On Your Farm Dont Drop Geodes Day One

I Wanna Put Together A Dnd Party Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Who Arent Friends; Mainly To See How Player Chemistry Would Form From Scratch Or If It Even Will
Itll Be Interesting To See If Two [[Branches/People\|People]] Hate Each Other Do They Reflect That In-Game Or Vice Versa

My Computer Now Starts With A Key

Also I Went To Las Iguanas To Eat, It Was Pretty Good

Oh And New Earphones Are Quite Good
Makes [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Feel A Little [[Skull/Spam/Crazy\|Crazy]] Though Because I Feel Like Im Listening To Shit In A Silent Room And Everyone's Just Like "Who The Fuck Is This Guy?"
Im Not Worried Theyre Judging [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Its Just A Very Large Tonal Shift

And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Media/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

Also Im Thinking Of Separating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To

On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

You Always Forget That Settlement--
What The Gell Is My Tinnitus Doing Today Its Bloody Distracting 

Holy Hell! Today Was So Awesome!! 52•2024•

Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

My Headphones Just Frog Blinked

Its Been A While Since Ive Watched A Psychopath Centred Show Whom I Dont Relate To But This Shiw Is Full Of Them And Thats Refreshing
I Dont Have More Intricate Notes Because I <b>Was</b> Playing Cult Of The Lamb So I Wasnt Actually Able To Type But Yeah I Think I'll Be Finishing This

Look At This Guy

I Realised That When You Write Wizard Maths To Make (Oh Yeah I Named It) The Wrighth (Like Write) Invisible You Can Write Maths By It
But If You Wrote A Wrighth Next To It To Turn The Maths Invisible Then The Maths Would Also Turn The Invisibility Wrighth Invisible
But Also You Could Add Wrighth To Glasses Or Something To Make The Invisible Wrighth Vidible 

So To Combat That You Add Wrighth To The Original Thing That Says Thag If Someone Uses The Read Invisible Wrighth Glasses Then Its Still Invisible
And You Have To Do That Ad Infinum

Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing\*- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And It Enjoyed Itself So All Is Good
\* Thats Meant To Say Pen

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 

I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

## Xenomorph Research
Xenomorph XX121 Is An Endoparasitoid With A "Multi-Staged Life Cycle". Theres A Planet Called Xenomorph Prime In The Alien Games But Its Not Ever Mentioned In The Films So Idk. Its Also A Hive Mind.

The appearance of the Xenomorph can vary depending on the host in which the embryo is implanted!
The Human phenotype is generally around 7–9 feet (~ 2.13 - 2.74 meters) in height and roughly 181.43 to 272.15 kilograms (400-600 pounds) in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. (You Know, The Classic)

The Scientific Name Is Internecivus raptus Which Means Murderous Thief
### More Appearence Stuff Stolen From The Wiki
The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (although some Queens have been shown to grow even larger, some surpassing 30 meters in height if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence compared to her common offspring.
