## The Top

I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters  
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet  
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired  
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

### Original Random Bulk

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie  
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout?  
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]  
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Party Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Comedy Show Im Going To Instead

ETA: I Did Show Up To The End, Saw Some Old Friends

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country  
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc)  
But Its Still Horrendous  
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research  
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both  
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Back To Random

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunshine]]
We Need To Talk More

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation  
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves  
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

### Randomness :3

I Did A Bit Of Tidying Up  
You Wont Notice

## This Is Imported

I Dont Get This Library  
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything  
So You Have To Be A Student To Read  
The Chemistry Is By Textiles  
The Psychology Is Above Renewable Energy  
And It Seems To Be Alphabetical Within The Subject?  
I Got To My Class And There Already [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] There (ETA: Not My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Other [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]])

First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two  
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination  
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

### Public Transport Rant (Train Edition)

The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im NeveR Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks  
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool  
Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train  
I Know All This Its All Goo  
The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed  
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like • _ •  
Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know  
Thats The Train I Got On

Interesting: I Can Boot Multiple Instances Of This Application Which (Since Its Locked) Means That I Cant Close Any Instances Of It

I Went Back And Added Some Stuff I Said To My [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunshine]]

Just Diagnosed Someone With Autism And They Were Like "....Yep"

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data  
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many [[Constant Comment (Not The Tea) (conflict 2024-02-13-13-58-21)\|Thoughts]], None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation  
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful  
Its Tuesday  
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void  
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

## Sneaky Imports

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish  
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That  
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific  
I Figured It Out!  
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages  
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...."  
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There  
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This"  
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing  
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I  
Want To Die

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours  
That Doesn't Sound Fun?  
Neither Does Breathing  
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel  
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**


Went To Bed At Like Six Last Night (For Eight Hours)  
Best Sleep Of Like A Month

I Think Most [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept  
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For  
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again"  
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya  
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy  
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason

I Wanted Tea

I Think Id Least Want [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Touching My Dead [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] If The Cause Of My Death Was Someone Touching My Live [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]]

It Has Come To My Attention (Via [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] What I Think Is Best For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]) That Since I Am Undergoing Zoochosis And That The Enrichment Time That I Usually Try To Provide Myself With Is A Failing Method,  The Best Thing For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] To Do For My Mental Health Is To Empty The Beehive More Frequently; The Problem Isnt My Mind, It's Keeping My Mind Locked Iniside Of Itself

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself

Hahahaha
Ha

Its 40•2024•4597 And I Am Losing My Mind But Im Back; Your Girl Is Back; I Am Typing Real Huamn Words-
That One Doesnt Count; Go To Hell

Im In 3AB002 And It Is Killing [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]; Im Actually Dying! This Lecture Is So Slow And I Know All Of It And The Lecturer Said That This Isnt Important Because He Knows The Test And We've Already Covered The Part Of This Subject Thatll Be On TheTest So do weNeed To Be Here? 
That Wasnt rethorical; No Is The Answer

43•2024• Maybe Fixed The [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Website]] 

Habib Sucks So Much
Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading HOL (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

I Know Its Not For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

My Mothers Trying To Tell [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] That Imposter Syndrome Is When Someone Pretends To Be You 

This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Os Driving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|people]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To

Oh Yeah Yesterday [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Roo/STOWAWAY SLUT (FREE)\|Roo]] Asked [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] If I Wanted To Play Overwatch And I Said Later Because I Was Tired; Later Came And I Asked Them And Got Rejected Because They Were Tired
Thats A Fair Reason (If It Wasnt I Wouldn't Have Used It) But Its Still Kinda Rude Because Yknow <b>You</b> Asked <b>[[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]</b> But Its Whatever So I Didnt Say Anything

On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Promonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube

If I cant Sleep Im actually Gonna Be Really Mad :)

Really Enjoying This Season For Some Reason

4k Zen Comp Play; 2nd Sup Comp Play In Half As Many Hours 
Going To Bed

52•2024•0359 Is [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Going To Bed Early So That Im Fully Rested For Dee <s>Tomorrow</s> Today 
Also Listening To Tma 99 Dust To Dust; Its A Gertrude Episode (Not Her Best Though)

Also, [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]], Its Boise City Oklahoma
You Always Forget That Settlement--
What The Gell Is My Tinnitus Doing Today Its Bloody Distracting 

Holy Hell! Today Was So Awesome!! 52•2024• 
I Got To Hang Out With Dee Like All Day-- 
(This App sucks (Crashed))
Anyway Got To Hers In The Wet, That Was Sad, But I Got A Hug And Some Tea Out Of It, Then We Watched Gravity Falls While I Failed To Source Cabin In The Woods Before Switching To The Goldbergs Then To Sweeny Todd
Dee Fell Asleep At One Point So I Took A Picture, Shes Cute (And Dhe Breathes Differently When Shes Asleep Which I Think Is Interesting) And I Love Her And Eventually [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Roo/STOWAWAY SLUT (FREE)\|Roo]] Showed Up And We Watched Most Of Hazbin Hotel (We Didnt Finish Episode Seven)
Also Excellent Bean Burgers 10/10
I Could Write So Much More Because This Was Such An Awesome Day But I Wont Because Privacy And Whatnot
However I Will Say Im Sad That I Didnt Wear Black Nails Lile I Pmanned Because Dee Did And I Got A Nice Picture Of Us Holding Hands 

I Just love Dee So Much

Also [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Roo/STOWAWAY SLUT (FREE)\|Roo]] Is Cool, Glad Theyre Safe And All That
