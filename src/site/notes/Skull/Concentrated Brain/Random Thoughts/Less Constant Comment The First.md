This Graph Is Frankly Insane
First Off The Idea That Anyone Said Gambling Is Hot Is Wild (Over 5% Somehow)
Cigars Are On The Fall, Thise Used To Be Huge
Playing Magic The Gathering Is About As Hot As Drinking
Also You Know That Arguing Online And Funko Are The Same People XD
Sorry I Like Stats And Felt Like Ranting

Trying To Reorganise Some Time With My Friends Today And One Of Them Said Theyll Be Too Tired After Work Then Later Said They Need To Be Home By 9 
If Youre Gonna Lie At Least Be Good At It? I Assumed They Were Anyway But Maybe Im Just Being Judgy Idk

That Doesnt Look Right....
    
## Anyway!    

Grim Was "perplexed by [My] setup" So Explanation
    
Bottom To Top: CD Player, Tape Player, Radio, Amp/Mixer
    
![üíõ](https://discord.com/assets/4252a4264c0874b9.svg)
    (Weird That I Can Paste So Much Of Discords UI But How Almost None Of It Looks Right)

CD Player Can Hold 5 CDs And Tape Player Can Hold Two Tapes
	I Dont Use The Radio But Its Nice To Have
Also The CD And Tape Player Are Joined By Wires At The Back (They All Are, I Wired Them) But One Of The Wires Is Like Part Of The Devices
I Think If I Broke One Id Either Have To Live With It Or Replace Both Of Them
    Well Those Two Are Stuck Together For Some Reason, Everythings All Kinda Connected To The Radio At The Moment‚Äî I'm Using It As A Junction For Everything Else
There Are So Many Ports And Holes In The Back Of The Radio So Im Taking Advantage Of It
    Theyre Also Connected To My Record Player Which Isnt In The Picture
So That I Can Easily Use The Mixer To Listen To Anything (Including My Computer)
        Been Working On This For Like Months
Its So Hard To Get Good Tech
    
We Both "feel like everything is getting more expensive but made shittier"
