# Shark Reproduction

I Just Found Out A Cool Shark Fact
Well Two Cool Shark Facts

1. almost a quarter of the brown lanternsharks found in Suruga Bay, Japan, have both male and female organs
2.  the blacktip shark can reproduce asexually

First Off
Obligitory [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/Sharks/Sharks\|Sharks]] Are Pretty Cool [[Template/Comment\|Comment]]
Because They Are Awesome
I Dont Want Both  Apenis And A Vagina, In Fact, I Want Neither Because I Think Both Absolutely Suck But I Do Love The Idea Of A Person Having Both Fully Functoinal
You DOnt Usually get That In Humans Sadly And I Think Thats A Waste Of Portential
Also The Ability To Reproduce Asexually Is Absolutely Amazing
But Godling What about Biodiversity
You Can Shove Your Biodiversity Up Your Ass
Intercourse Is A Terrible Way For A Species To Reproduce And If You Thought About It For FIve Seeconds Youd Probably Agree
Most Non-Mammalian Animals (From What I Know) Dont Even Engage In Intersourse And Have Other Ways Of Combining Male And FEmale Gametes
BUT Thats Besides The Point
teh point IS that Some [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/Sharks/Sharks\|Sharks]] Being Hermaphroditic And Some Being [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Asexual\|Asexual]] Is The Peak Of Reproductive Practices
If You Need To Reproduce You Always Can
You Can Get A More Biodiverse Offspring Or Just Get [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] That You Know Already Works
Also CAn You Imagine That As A Human Pairing?
Thats Awesome
One Person With A Full Set Of Genitali And Another Person With Just None?
The Actual Dream

Imagine Being A Hermaphrodite **And** Being Able To Reproduce Asexually
sUrvival Of The Fittest Is Fake And [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/Sharks/Sharks\|Sharks]] Run The World

Also Im Going To Leave This Note Open For Future [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Incase I Ever Start Researching Like Shark Mating Rituals Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]
oR Maybe Why Some [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/Sharks/Sharks\|Sharks]] Lay Eggs And Others Dont
