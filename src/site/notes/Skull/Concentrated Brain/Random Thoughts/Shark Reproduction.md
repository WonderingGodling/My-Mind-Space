# Shark Reproduction

I Just Found Out A Cool Shark Fact
Well Two Cool Shark Facts

1. almost a quarter of the brown lanternsharks found in Suruga Bay, Japan, have both male and female organs
2.  the blacktip shark can reproduce asexually

I Dont Want Both  Apenis And A Vagina, In Fact, I Want Neither Because I Think Both Absolutely Suck But I Do Love The Idea Of A Person Having Both Fully Functoinal
You DOnt Usually get That In Humans Sadly And I Think Thats A Waste Of Portential
Also The Ability To Reproduce Asexually Is Absolutely Amazing
But Godling What about Biodiversity
You Can Shove Your Biodiversity Up Your Ass
Intercourse Is A Terrible Way For A Species To Reproduce And If You Thought About It For FIve Seeconds Youd Probably Agree
Most Non-Mammalian Animals (From What I Know) Dont Even Engage In Intersourse And Have Other Ways Of Combining Male And FEmale Gametes
BUT Thats Besides The Point
teh point IS that Some Sharks Being Hermaphroditic And Some Being Asexual Is The Peak Of Reproductive Practices
If You Need To Reproduce You Always Can
You Can Get A More Biodiverse Offspring Or Just Get Something That You Know Already Works
Also CAn You Imagine That As A Human Pairing?
Thats Awesome
One Person With A Full Set Of Genitali And Another Person With Just None?
The Actual Dream

Also Im Going To Leave This Note Open For Future Me Incase I Ever Start Researching Like Shark Mating Rituals Or Something
oR Maybe Why Some [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/Sharks/Sharks\|Sharks]] Lay Eggs And Others Dont
