# Phobophilia

So Basically Most People Are Scared Of Something Right
They Have Some Kind Of Phobia Or Thing They Cant Stand To Be Exposed To But I Started To Wonder If Just Like Most People Are Fearful Of Something Most People Have Like An Opposing Philia(?)
Not Philia Like A Sex Thing Thats Both Gross And Not What We're Talking About Here But Like For As Many People There Are Who Get This Feeling Where Youre On The Edge Of Death When Youre Looking Down From High Places Youre There Are Just As Many People Who Instead Feel The Most Alive When Theyre Up Closer To The Sun
(So Acrophobia Vs Acrophilia)
I Think A Love For Something Can Have Just As Much (Or Maybe Even More) Of An Affect On Defining Who You Are As A Paralyzing Fear Of Something

Using Myself As An Example (Because Any Metaphysical/Psychological Concept Should Be Explained Using The Person Who Proposed It As An Example)
Estemophobia
Thats The Fear Of Knowledge Or Learning Something New
I Feel Most Comfortable Opposing This So Estemophilia
Which Ill Describe As A Desire To Acquire More, New Information

This Is An Unrelated Thought Im Adding In Editing But Love You [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunny]]
