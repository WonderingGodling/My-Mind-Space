# Phobophilia

So Basically Most [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Are Scared Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] Right
They Have Some Kind Of Phobia Or Thing They Cant Stand To Be Exposed To But I Started To Wonder If Just Like Most [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Are Fearful Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] Most [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Have Like An Opposing Philia(?)
Not Philia Like A Sex Thing Thats Both Gross And Not What We're Talking About Here But Like For As Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] There Are Who Get This Feeling Where Youre On The Edge Of Death When Youre Looking Down From High Places Youre There Are Just As Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Facts/People/People\|People]] Who Instead Feel The Most Alive When Theyre Up Closer To The Sun
(So Acrophobia Vs Acrophilia)
I Think A Love For [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] Can Have Just As Much (Or Maybe Even More) Of An Affect On Defining Who You Are As A Paralyzing Fear Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]

Using Myself As An Example (Because Any Metaphysical/Psychological Concept Should Be Explained Using The Person Who Proposed It As An Example)
Estemophobia
Thats The Fear Of Knowledge Or Learning [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] New
I Feel Most Comfortable Opposing This So Estemophilia
Which Ill Describe As A Desire To Acquire More, New Information

This Is An Unrelated Thought Im Adding In Editing But Love You [[Explicitly Showcased/Sunshine/Sunshine\|Sunny]]
