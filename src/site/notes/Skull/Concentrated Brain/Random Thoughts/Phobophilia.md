# Phobophilia

So Basically Most People Are Scared Of Something Right
They Have Some Kind Of Phobia Or Thing They Cant Stand To Be Exposed To But I Started To Wonder If Just Like Most People Are Fearful Of Something Most People Have Like An Opposing Philia(?)
Not Philia Like A Sex Thing Thats Both Gross And Not What We're Talking About Here But Like Instead Of Being Unbearably Uncomfortable In High Places Youre Actually Extremely Comfortable There
So Acrophobia Vs Acrophilia
