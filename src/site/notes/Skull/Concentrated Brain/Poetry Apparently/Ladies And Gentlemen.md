Ladies And Gentlemen Skinny And Stout
Let Me Tell You A Tale I Know Nothing About
The Admission Is Free So Pay At The Door
Now Pull Up A Chair And Sit On The Floor

One Bright Day In The Middle Of The Night
Two Dead Boys Got Up To Fight

Since One Was Bind And The Other Couldnâ€™t See
They Chose A Dummy As A Referee

A Blind Man Came To See Fair Play
A Mute Man Came To Shout Hooray

So Back To Back They Faced Each Other
Drew Their Swords And Shot Each Other
A Deaf Policeman Heard The Noise 
And Ran Up To Save The Two Dead Boys

A Pasrylised Donkey Passing By
Kicked The Blind Man In The Eye
He Crashed Through A Wall Not Making A Sound
Fell In A Dry Ditch And Promptly Drowned

A Mute Onlooker Shrieked In Fright
A Lame Man Ran From The Ghastly Sight
A Short White Hearse Came To Cart Him Away
But He Ran For His Life And Is Still Gone Today

I Saw This From The Corner Of King Arthurs Table
With The Only Witness To The Facts Of My Fable
So If You Dont Believe That My Lies Are True
Just Ask The Blind Man He Saw It Too
