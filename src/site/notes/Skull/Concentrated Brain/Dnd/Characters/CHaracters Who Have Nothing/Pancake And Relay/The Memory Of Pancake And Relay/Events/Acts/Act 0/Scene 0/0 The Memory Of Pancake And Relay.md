# Act 0 Scene 0

Time: just before sundown

Lord Alan Phantomhive has invited the party to celebrate the end of the new year as what he feels is a last hoorah.
He claims that the most powerful, all-knowing person he has had the pleasure to come across  has told him that he will die on the last night of the year so tonight he has invited the party to celebrate as a way to celebrate what has been. 
Lord Phantomhive has invited his old "friends" (the party) to celebrate what may be his last night so he wants a peaceful, happy and understanding atmosphere for the duration of the entire night. So no violence
He has organised:
- a high-quality telescope (saint peter the inverted)
    - Gets Finished Between The Murder And Everyone Waking Up
- Comedy (duet by sigma and ligma) 
    - Nothing Special
- meal for everyone to enjoy (Sweeny Marche)
    - Nobody Gets To Try Any
- Butler (the butler)
    - Good Fighter
