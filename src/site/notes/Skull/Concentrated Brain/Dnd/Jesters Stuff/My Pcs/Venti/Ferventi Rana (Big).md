cynical, Determined, Sense Of Justice, Knows Theyre In A Game

Why Do The Good Always Suffer When We Are Powerless Against It? Do The Gods Give Life Because Its Fun To Take Away?

loves Cats And Board Games, Eclipses Are Beautiful, 

Hates People More Than Curses, Will Do Anything For The "Right" Reason

Backstory
Born After Their Older Brother Had Already Passed, Ferventi Grew Up Under A Lot Of Pressure To Be Perfect. Pressure That She Felt Couldnt Be Lived Up To But Had To Be Confronted Nonetheless. Her Parents Were Nice Enough, Their Mom Was A Fishmonger And Their Dad Was A Magic Circle Inspector. She Didnt Have The Most Lavish Life Growing Up But It Was Better Than Average. The Fish Business Is Still Strong But Their Father Has Retired Somewhat Recently, He Wasnt Forced To Or Anything, He Just No Longer Has The Heart To Keep Up The Inspection Business. Its Been A While Since Venti Left Home And Though The Family Arent Necessarily On Speaking Terms With Each Other There Will Still Be The Odd Letter Finding Her Every Now And Then, She Tries To Right Back But Its Hard.

Its Not Like Anyhting Was Ever Perfect, They Always Felt Like They Were One Push Away From The Edge, One Insignificant Expectation Away From Losing Her Mind But That Never Happened. No, Instead The Gods Remembered That They Had Given Her A Gift. Its More Like A Consolation Prize.

A Tattered Shell Of What You Can Imagine Was Once A Revolver But Is Now Some Metallic Shell Riddled With Holes And Deliberate Looking Scratches. Its A Miracle This Piece Of Junk Can Hold Itself Together. If You Use It You Better Hope The Explosion Comes From The Part Pointing Away From You.

Having Missed Ferventi (Obviously In An Attempt To Flirt) The Attacker Is Now Infatuated With Her

Reverse technique:
Costs 2 cursed energy 
Reaction strike (prerequisite: creature has to miss a attack on you )
After a creature misses a attack you may strike back with a unarmed strike, on a hit  you charm the creature for three rounds or until you attack them, as well as this they will listen to basic commands as if under the effect of the suggestion spell

## <center><span style="color:#CC550D">Quid Pro Quo</span></center>

You Scratch My Back; I'll Scratch Yours Also Works When Both Parties Have Claws. Being No Stanger To Being Stabbed In The Back, Venti Had Her Eye On This One And Has Counted Their Transgressions, Until The Fires Of Hell Can Bring Forth Retribution Part Of It Will Be Hand Delivered By Yours Truly.

Improved reverse technique:
Action
Consumed ⅓ of the damage you wish to use 
During a fight pick one creature, you now may tally how much  damage they do to you throughout the fight, at any point during it you can consume ⅓ of that damage as curse energy then fire back all of it at a enemy, the attack is unable to miss unless a technique is used 
(i.e if you are hurt for 15 dmg overall then you consume 5 cursed energy then deal 15dmg to them)

## <center><span style="color:#000000">The Voids Embrace</span></center>


The Rapid Expansion And Escape Of Ferventi Rana's Emotions Created A Blanket Of Chaos Ending All Feeling Within The Domain. Exposure To The Void Causes Emotions To Spiral As One Tries To Gain Control Of Them. Escaping The Void Leaves One Longing For Its Embrace And Temporarily Unable To Properly Function Without It.

Action 
Consumes 8 cursed energy, costs 2  energy to maintain  
Causes the frightened effect as well as stunning for a turn after the domain closes
For two turns after the domain closes a user who was caught in it can’t use any cursed energy they also have disadvantage on physical strike 
Rewritten
drain curse points, turn invisible

## <center><span style="color:#892102">Warning Shot</span></center>

When Ferventi's Adrenaline Gets Too High They Lash Out Both Physically And Emotionally, Striking Their Opponent With A Personalised Curse. The Pain Of The Curse Settling In Subsides As Their Senses Are Filled With A Manifestation Of Their Greatest Fear. It Overwhelms Them Until She Lets Them Go And The Curse Energy Drains Out.

Reaction 
Consume 3 cursed energy and perform a reaction strike pouring cursed energy into your weapon/fist on an unsuccessful hit (+5) the opponent sees the attack form into their greatest fear causing them to take 2d8 curse damage and  go into the frightened status and abandoning whatever their current motivation was
Consume a extra 1 energy every turn you wish for this effect to stay active
If Known: At The End incapacitated, can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.

Prerequisite: have to be 40ft away
