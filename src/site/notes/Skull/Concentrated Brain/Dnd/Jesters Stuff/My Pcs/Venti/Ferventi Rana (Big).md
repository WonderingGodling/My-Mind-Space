cynical, Determined, Sense Of Justice, Knows Theyre In A Game

Why Do The Good Always Suffer When We Are Powerless Against It? Do The Gods Give Life Because Its Fun To Take Away?

loves Cats And Board Games, Eclipses Are Beautiful, 

Hates People More Than Curses, Will Do Anything For The "Right" Reason

Backstory
Born After Their Older Brother Had Already Passed, Ferventi Grew Up Under A Lot Of Pressure To Be Perfect. Pressure That She Felt Couldnt Be Lived Up To But Had To Be Confronted Nonetheless. Her Parents Were Nice Enough, Their Mom Was A Fishmonger And Their Dad Was A Magic Circle Inspector. She Didnt Have The Most Lavish Life Growing Up But It Was Better Than Average. The Fish Business Is Still Strong But Their Father Has Retired Somewhat Recently, He Wasnt Forced To Or Anything, He Just No Longer Has The Heart To Keep Up The Inspection Business. Its Been A While Since Venti Left Home And Though The Family Arent Necessarily On Speaking Terms With Each Other There Will Still Be The Odd Letter Finding Her Every Now And Then, She Tries To Right Back But Its Hard.

Its Not Like Anyhting Was Ever Perfect, They Always Felt Like They Were One Push Away From The Edge, One Insignificant Expectation Away From Losing Her Mind But That Never Happened. No, Instead The Gods Remembered That They Had Given Her A Gift. Its More Like A Consolation Prize.
