# Characteristics 


##### Amulet Of The Devout
This amulet bears the symbol of a deity inlaid with precious stones or metals. While you wear the holy symbol, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. The bonus is +2. While you wear this amulet, you can use your Channel Divinity feature without expending one of the feature's uses. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
##### Creative Liberty
This Is Why You Should Separate The Art From The Artist
The Curse Energy That Flows Through You Turns Your Will And Creativity Into Something More Than The Sum Of Its Parts. Shaping And Moulding The World Into What It Could Have Been If It Only Had The Artistic Freedom.

Richer Medium
For As Long As Your In It, The World Is Made Better Than It Once Was. The Area That You Are In Is Transformed To Reflect A Comic Book, Changing The Way Your Surroundings Can Be Perceived: Sound Effects Made Are Manifested, A Strong Wind Can Be Seen, Etc.
Cannot Be Turned Off

Life Imitates Art
Art- Such As Paintings Or Sculptures- That You Are Near Gains Sentience And Things That You Have Drawn Can Be Brought Into Reality. Manifestations Last An Amount Of Time Equal To Your Performance Modifier But Cannot Be Edited Outside Of Its Original Medium

Screenshot Protection
People Cannot Recall Your Art Without Your Permission. If A Person Has Your Permission To Recall Art Based Off Real Events, Then Your Embellishments Are Believed

Art-iculative
Regardless Of What You Are Trying T0 Create With (Pictures, Clay, Words) As Long As You Have The Materials Your Will Is A Sufficient Enough Tool




##### Domain Expansion: Spilt Ink
No Use Crying

A Large Effigy Of An Ink Bottle Spills Over You And Everything Within Range, Everything Going Black. The Domain Counts As Magical Darkness For Everyone But You Obscuring All Physical And Metaphysical Details. Features, Magic And Abilities Are No Longer Usable By Others Until A Number Of Rounds After The Domain Closes
