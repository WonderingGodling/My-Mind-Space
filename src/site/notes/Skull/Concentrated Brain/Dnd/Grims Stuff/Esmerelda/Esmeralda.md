#### Reliable Dancers

Starting at 1st level, gain proficiency in Performance. If you already have proficiency, you apply double your proficiency bonus instead.

#### Spellcasting

At 1st level, you gain the ability to cast spells through your mystical dance.

##### Cantrips

At 1st level, you learn one cantrip from the sorcerer's spell list. You learn additional cantrips as increase in level, as shown on the class table, which you select from this list or from the sorcerer's spell list.

In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cantrips you know and replace it with another cantrip from the sorcerer's list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your arcane blade dancer spells, since you cast a spell through a set of very specific set of arcane dance moves. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a arcane blade dancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Spellcasting Components

Your dance is your only component required for your Arcane Blade spell. For that reason, all your spells have only Somatic as their component, even if they originally have other component. You can't cast Arcane Blade spells if you are unable to move.

#### Magical Dance

At 1st level, you learn to infuse your magic into your movement and weapons.

##### Blade Dance

While not wearing armor, your AC equals your spell save DC. If you're wielding a weapon in one hand and no other weapon, your AC increases by 2.

In addition, at 3rd level and again at 6th, and 14th levels, you can choose one dancing technique, from the Dance Techniques list.

##### Arcane Blade

You can use a ritual to use the sheer power of your magic to summon a sword made of pure arcane power. Your arcane blade can take the form of any simple or martial melee weapon you are proficient with. The weapon hovers in the air within 5 feet of you.

When you finish a long rest, you can change the form of the arcane blade. You can use a bonus action to make the blade disappear, and you can make it reappear as a bonus action on your turn.

You can also make a ritual to bind yourself with a magic weapon, converting the weapon into an arcane blade. You can perform the ritual over the course of a long rest, and the weapon needs to be within touch over the course of the whole rest. If the weapon requires attunement, you can bond with the weapon over the course of the attunement. You can't bind yourself with more than one weapon at the same time.

In addition, at 2nd level and again at 10th, and 19th levels, you can choose one power for your arcane blade, from the Blade Powers list.

#### Arcane Smite

At 2nd level, you can channel your magic and elemental power into a powerful smite. You learn a number of smites equal to your proficiency bonus. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace a smite you know for a new one.

You can use a smite whenever you hit a creature with your Arcane Blade. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining all your uses after finishing a long rest.

If an elemental smite requires a save DC, you use your cantrip save DC.

#### Dance Style

At 3rd level, you chose a dance style. Choose between the Dance of the Enchanter or the Dance of the Warrior; both are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th and 14th levels.

#### Ability Score Increase

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Arcane Assault

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, with your Arcane Blade. In addition, you can forgo one of your attacks to cast an Arcane Blade Dancer cantrip instead.

#### Magical Channeling

Starting at 6th level, you can use your bonus action to enhance the power of your smites by channeling arcane power into your blade, increasing the power of any of your smites when you do so. Doing so adds your Charisma modifier to the additional damage caused by the attack.

Also, the duration of any effect that has a duration is increased to 1 minute. In addition, the range of any effect that has a range is increased in 5 feet.

Once you use the channeling, you can't do it again until you finish a short or a long rest.

#### Cat's Grace

At 6th level, you can reroll any failed Dexterity or Charisma check a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, regaining the ability to do so after finishing a long rest.

#### Combos

Starting at 9th level, you can attack with fluidity and grace. Whenever you hit a creature with your Arcane Blade, you gain 1 combo point. You can have an amount of combo points equal to your proficiency bonus, and any unspent combo point is lost when you finish a long rest.

You can spend your combo points to perform combo maneuvers, shown below.

##### Gracious Movement

You can spend 1 combo point to take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action.

##### Deep Wound

You can spend 1 combo point when you hit a creature to cause additional damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This maneuver doesn't recover combo points.

##### Blade Flourish

You can spend 1 combo point as a bonus action to make one additional attack with the Arcane Blade. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or you hit it again. Only the first attack recovers a combo point. If you reduce a target to 0 hit points with this maneuver, you recover 3 combo points.

##### Reactive Blade

You can spend 1 combo point to regain the use of your reaction.

##### Increased Movement

You can spend any amount of combo points to increase your movement speed by 10 feet per point spent.

#### Improved Arcane Assault

At 11th level, whenever you attack with your Arcane Blade, you can cast an Arcane Blade Dancer cantrip as a bonus action.

#### Increased Agility

At 13th level, you have advantage on any Dexterity saving throws against effects you can see.

#### Superior Critical

Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks with the Arcane Blade score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.

#### Magical Cut

At 17th level, once on each of your turns when you miss an attack roll against a creature, the creature takes force damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

In addition, you no longer can have disadvantage on attack rolls when making attacks with the arcane blade.

#### Arcane Reflection

Starting at 18th level, whenever a creature casts a spell against you, you can make a saving throw against the result of the attack (if the spell uses an attack roll) or against the save DC, using your reaction. On a success, you can reflect the spell against a creature within range.

After using this ability successfully, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### Dance Master

Starting at 20th level, your Dexterity and Charisma increase by 4, to a maximum of 24.

In addition, at the start of your turn if you have 0 combo points, you gain 1 combo point.

### Dance of the Warrior

Those who seek to learn the warrior's dance follow the path of combat. These arcane blade dancers use magic as weapon, but secondary to their prowess with the swords. They use the dance steps not only to weave magic, but as a way of fighting in an unpredictable manner.

#### Instinctive Blades

Starting at 3rd level, you can sense your enemies even without seeing them. You no longer suffer disadvantage on your attack rolls due to not being able to see your target.

In addition, whenever you use a smite, the magical energy lingers on the creature, giving you advantage on your next attack roll against that creature.

#### Magic Charge

Starting at 7th level, you can charge against your enemies with mighty rage. As an action, you can teleport to a place you can see within 20 feet. When you teleport using your action, you can make an attack or cast a cantrip as a bonus action.

In addition, for each 10 feet you teleport before making the attack, you can deal additional damage equal to 2d8 force damage with the attack or cantrip.

#### Careful Step

At 10th level, you can quickly dodge the attacks of your opponents. You can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a opportunity attack against you.

In addition, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks against any target you smite or charge towards in combat.

#### Unstoppable Pursuer

When you reach the 14th level, you can point towards a creature you can see and use your reaction to mark it. For 1 minute, you can use your action to teleport to a point you can see within 5 feet of that creature, at cost of your movement. If you do so, you can make an attack as a bonus action. Doing so triggers the additional damage of your Magical Charge.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain the uses after finishing a long rest.

### Arcane Smites

#### Solar Smite

When you hit a creature with this smite, the creature needs to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage and become blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Earth Smite

When you hit a creature with this smite, the creature needs to succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone on a failed save and takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage.

#### Planar Smite

When you hit a creature with this smite, the creature needs to succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the creature is banished back to its plane, or to a harmless demi-plane if the creature is on its native plane, until the end of its next turn, when it reappears in the same or nearest unoccupied space.
