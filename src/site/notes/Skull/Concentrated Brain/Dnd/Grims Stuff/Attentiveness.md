# Attentiveness- Quinn

  

Those who follow attentiveness believe that to be idle is to be lost,  they use every second of every minute of every hour to the maximum efficiency,  they hate to lose even a moment to idle motion. If not effective in life then  they are not alive  

—

If following attentiveness a character gains these effects

( you gain one use of the fighters action surge feature that you can use once per long rest.

Once per long rest you may use [channel divinity: effective action] once used the user  may transfer their action,bonus action or reaction into a different one [e.g:  turn a bonus action and reaction into two extra actions] the user may do this for the next two turns [the turn counter triggers after the turn used to trigger this ability])
