----------

You apply the attack modifier to the second weapons attack as well as the first 
You can consume 11 cursed energy to then  use a third tool for two turns

#### Cursed tool devastation 
By 20th level, you have mastered cursed tools, while other curse users may outmatch you in a short fight, you excel at now relying on your cursed energy, because of this your excess cursed energy can be put into increasing the power and speed of your cursed tools

----


### Consumed curse 
A consumed curse is a curse user whose  soul has been mostly taken over by their curse, leading them to exhibit signs related to the emotions that formed their curse (e.g a curse formed from hatred causes the user to show more signs of anger towards things) this is a much more primal and raw form of cursed energy

You gain a Raw technique, a much stronger but much more self destructive version of your normal cursed technique , when you perform a Raw technique consume however many Raw energy is needed for it and give yourself 1 level of exhaustion each time you use it 


You may  combined two types of Technique(other then a special) without the technique costing substantially more )


Physical technique 
Ranged technique 
Condition technique 
Support technique 
Special technique  (doesn’t fit into any category, or implements more then two techniques, will cost more raw cursed energy)






#### Raw reflection
By 13th level,  your Raw energy has spread even further through your soul causing your raw energy to spill out even when using normal cursed energy moves

#### Soul consumed 
By 20th level, your curse has grown in power from your own negative emotions, consuming your soul fully, while you exist as the mind, the curse exists as your body working as one to achieve your goals now fueled by the emotion that formed the curse


You no longer get exhaustion from performing your Raw technique  or Raw reflection
Your raw technique evolves, you can now have three types of technique without it consuming a larger amount of raw energy (or you may have one type of technique mixed with a special technique that does not use multiple it self) 
You gain weakness to curse damage 
 You gain resistance to physical damage 


----


### Alter ego 
A alter ego is a curse user who has a incredibly powerful curse dwelling within them, these are curses who gained sentience from their raw power or the strong emotion that formed them, these can also be mortal races who became a consumed curse and achieved a large amount of power before dying 


(talk with dm to create the curse within you and their own abilities)


#### Take control
By 2nd level your alter ego dwells within you  and will try to get free,  


As a action you can ask your curse to take control of your body, when this happens your form will take on characteristics of that curse, they will gain new stats, new health, new abilities and a different subclass from you with their own domain expansion and  cursed technique 


Your curse can try to take control from you whenever they want, when this happens you do a Constitution save equal to your 8 + your curse user level 


You can make a pact with your curse to ensure they do not force control away from you, you must do this as a long rest 

#### Energy siphon 
By 9th level,your curse feels pity on you when you start to lose your cursed energy, giving you some of their own to keep the fight going

#### Overstepped bounds 
By 13th level, your curse has come to tolerate you and doesn’t want any lowly creature to end you


If you are incapacitated by a creature with a lower challenge rating then the level of your curse then your body will be taken over by your curse automatically, and then perform their domain expansion instantaneously, for three more turns the curse can perform their cursed technique as a free action without consuming cursed energy, after these three turns the curse becomes bored with the fight and lets you have control, leaving you incapacitated once more but with one successful death save 
Can only be used once per long rest


#### Equalibrium 
By 20th level,  you and your curse exist in a sort of harmony, cohabiting the same body in order to each achieve your own goals to this end your curse is willing to help you out of kindness instead of trickery 


Whenever you perform a cursed  technique it is followed up by your curse’s  own cursed technique 
If you perform domain expansion your curse will  use their raw cursed technique as well as their improved cursed technique against each opponent, any effect or hit will land because of the effects from a domain expansion 


 When overstepped bounds ends, you now will start with two successful death saves


----


### Cursed speech
A cursed speech user  is someone who’s cursed energy can be channeled into their own voice, affecting the world and those around them with mere words, while powerful it is very dangerous for both the user and others around that user, the stronger the words used are the harder it is to channel the cursed energy, this can end up causing the word to be brought back onto you or to just cause damage to your throat making you unable to use cursed speech for a extended period or in more extreme cases causing internal bleeding 


#### Words of power 
By 2nd level You gain the  ability to channel your cursed energy into cursed speech at the cost of the more concentrated forms of cursed energy

A curse speech user has no control of when their energy is used, meaning if any term other then words that cannot be used as words of power (these are normally mundane words that are not commands or terms that can be used to affect something[e.g names,ingredients,places) this makes them very dangerous to fellow group members if the user is not careful with their speech] 


harmless = 0 + creatures con mod 


mild effect (anything you could manually do yourself) 2 + creatures con modifier


medium effect (effects you would not be able to do yourself/ supportive abilities[e.g "stop" "run" "hide" "heal" "help" "betray"]) 4+ creatures con modifier 


strong effect (a effect that could change the tide of battle or greatly affect a strong foe [e.g "crush" "bleed" "go away" "freeze" "surrender") 6 + creatures level]
