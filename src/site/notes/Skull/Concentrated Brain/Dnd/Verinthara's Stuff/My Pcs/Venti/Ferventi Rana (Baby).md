Hates People More Than Curses But Kills Curses As An Outlet, Will Do Anything For The "Right" Reason, Gets Pushed Into Most Things By Her Parents

Always Gets Told She Looks Like A Rana, That She Has The Same Hair As Her Mother And That Her Unnaturally Pointed Ears Always Make It Easy To Remember Which One She Is. She Never Gets Told That Her Eyes Have The Same Sparkle That Her Siblings Get Complimented On Or That Her Skin Having Darkened Over The Years Looks Nice In Contrast To The Rest Of The Family.

Backstory
Born In Western England, After Their Eldest Brother Had Already Passed, Ferventi Grew Up Under A Lot Of Pressure To Be Perfect. Pressure That She Felt Couldnt Be Lived Up To But Had To Be Confronted Nonetheless. Her Parents Were Nice Enough I Guess, Her Mom Was The Donor Of The Rana Bloodline, Their Dad Was A Magic Inspector. With Both Her Parents In Different Magic Worlds, She Didnt Get The Most Attention Growing Up But It Was Better Than Average As Far As She Knew. Her Father Has Retired Somewhat Recently, He Wasnt Forced To Or Anything, He Just No Longer Has The Heart To Keep Up The Inspection Business. 

Its Been A While Since Venti Left Home Under Her Family's "suggestion" And Though Most Of The Immediate Family Arent Necessarily On Speaking Terms With Each Other There Will Still Be The Odd Letter Finding Her Every Now And Then, She Tries To Write Back But Its Hard.

Over The Past Few Years Shes Been Trying To Get Used To The Effects Her Curses Have On Her Life, Trying To Understand The World Shes Forced To Live In. The Blissful Ignorance Of Youth Isnt Something That Shes Able To Enjoy Thus She Hopes That Once Shes An Adult, Things Will Be Different.

Its Not Like Anything Was Ever Perfect, They Always Felt Like They Were One Push Away From The Edge, One Insignificant Expectation Away From Losing Her Mind But That Never Happened. No, Instead The Gods Remembered That They Had Given Her A Gift. Its More Like A Consolation Prize.
