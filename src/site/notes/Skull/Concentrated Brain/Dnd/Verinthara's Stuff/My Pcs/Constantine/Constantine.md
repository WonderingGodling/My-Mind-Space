#### Unseen Servant

Servants: AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack.

Then Out Of The Ashes: Familliar

After The Ritual: The Familiars Act Independently But Obey Commands. While Having Their Own Combat Initiative They Cannot Attack.
As An Action They Can Relay Sensory Stimuli, Be Sent To/From Their Personal Dimension Or Released From Service.  If The Familiars Die They Retreat To Their Dimension (Without Any Material Possessions) Until The Ritual Is Undergone Again.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

1: Draw Pattern Across Chest With Chalk, Outline Skeleton "Protection, Protection Pro......tection"
2: Bones Start To Rise Out Of The Ground And Slowly Float Towards The Target (If Target Is Someone Within 60ft: Point "Of Course You Need My Help"), Then A Bell Noise Sounds As The Ritual Ends

More Time Put Into This Ritual Necrotises The Creature More (1d10)

#### Acid Stream
1: Mortar And Pestle A Heart Into Paste, Add Spit
2: Use As Lipstick (Not Necessary, There Is Just A Lot Of Downtime Right Here), "Styx Calls Your Name", Pour The Mixture Onto The Floor, The Mixture Keeps Pouring  And As The Stream Grows Screams And Wails Seep Out More And More Until It Floods Across A Five-By-Thirty ft Area For A Minute And The Sounds Stop Dead

After The Ritual: Each Creature Caught In The Flood Must Be Dexterous Enough To Not Succumb To The Styx, If They Do They Must Remove Its Remnants From Either Themselves Or Their Companion To Stop It From Eating Away From Them (3d4 Acid At The Start Of Its Turn)

More Time Spent On The Ritual Empowers The Styx (1d4)

# Characteristics 
Enter My Character: Sporting An Alligator Backpack And A Large, Light Coat, Stained Red With A Cape Like The Size Of Texas Or Just Rhode Island. Matching The Cape With Blood Red Lipstick And Eyes That Stare Daggers On The Best Of Days.
Silvered Hair, Some Strands Are More Reminiscent Of Ash, Would Contract With Faer Dark Skin If It Weren't Covered In A Light Layer Of Some Dusty Substance (Probably Chalk—Witches Love Chalk) Oh Shoot Spoiler, This Bitch Is A Witch, A Spooky Scary One 
As Fae Stand Now, Faer Right Hand Is In Faer Coat Pocket And The Left Is Holding An Ivory Coin....

Connie Is Not Depressed Fae're Just Like That
Whenever Fae Cast A Spell Fae Count The Seconds (Timing Is The Hardest Part For Faer)
Will Kill People But Not Because Fae Enjoy It, That's Dumb
Calls All Their Undead Lazarus
Constantine Is Not Evil, Fae're Not Nice But That's More Out Of Necessity 
Some Of Faer Spells Use Chalk And Fae Hate It, Fae Are Trying To Find A Chalk Replacement
Mostly Emotes Through Faer Eyes (Might Be Incapable Of Smiling)
Sometimes Uses Noises To Convey Messages Instead Of Words Like "That Was Aagh"
Loves We'll Meet Again
Cares For Their Lazari (Plural Of Lazarus) And Shows That Through Constantly Putting Them To Work
Plays With The Ivory Coin A Lot, Knowing That Its Impossible To Lose It Makes It The Only Things That Is Truly Safe
If Fae Have To Be Social Instinct Will Dictate Hostility
Wears Brass Knuckles Because They Are Worried That Otherwise Punching Someone Will Break Their Hand (The Fact That They Look Cool Is A Happy Accident)
Has Skeleton Grabby Arm
Component Pouch Acts Like Meat Freezer
Cracks Their Joints A Lot
Used To Doing Everything By Faerself So Is Good In/With Nature
7ft Tall


Used To Be The Apprentice Of A (Locally) Famous Litch That Fae Hunted Down And Became The Apprentice Of, Sadly They Have Since Been Soul Gemed So Fae Are Now Supposed To Be The Apprentice Of Some Other Necromancer (Because They Were Threatened Into It And Didnt Want Madam-Chainsaw To Be Left Alone)
Supportive Wicca Ghost Girlfriend
​ ​‍​ ​‍​ ​‍​ ​‍Doesnt Agree With Constantine's World Domination Kick But Is Happy Fae Have A Hobby
