Theyre These Jewels That Can Slot Together, When You Put Ten Of Them Together They Go Up To The Next Value
And They Turn Into Liquid To Store Them
I Drew One A Few Days Ago And I Spent My Trip To The Shop Thinking About Logistics And Stuff
Ten Of Them (Well I Guess Nine Of Them) Joined Together Can Just About Sit In Your Hand Comfortably, When You Have Ten Bronze Ones They Shrink And Appear Silver
Oh Yeah Instead Of Wallets People Have Jars
And The Volume Can Be Translated Into Value (Like How Cash Used To Be Weight Dependent)
You Can See The Liquid Inside The Gems Too 
Theyre The Colour Of The Next Value Up
Auto Chains
Liquid Acts Alive
Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum -> Black
## Jewel Jar
Easy Storage And Transportation
Almost Always Made From Glass Or Some Other See-Through Material
The Lip Of The Jar Has A Magic Array That Shifts The Jewels From Solid To Liquid
When In Liquid Form You Can See All The Colours That The Value Is Composed Of Mixing Together
You Can Pour Out The Liquid Or Jewels In Whatever Combination You Want
