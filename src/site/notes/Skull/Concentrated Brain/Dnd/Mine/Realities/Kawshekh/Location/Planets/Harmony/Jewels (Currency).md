## Post- Starfall
### Origin
Nobody knows where they originally came from but they were found about thirty to fifty years after starfall
### Appearance
They are indestructible, crystals surrounding an erratically moving liquid. The colour of the crystal is how they are referred to as they can be compared to the oldest known currency form (Precious metals). The Colour Of The Liquid Inside Reflects The Next Value Up. they Don't Make Sound When They Hit Something So You Cant Get A Coinflip Sound Effect With Them :(
### Structure
These Jewels Are Quite Large As Far As Money Goes. The Jewels Have Notches In Them That Allow Them To Be Slotted Together, Ten Connected Regularly Can Just About Fit In The Hand Of A Medium Creature And Become A Jewel Of A Higher Value. They Then Shrink Back Down And Repeat This Pattern.

Which Was The Primary Form Of The Currency When They Were Discovered But Now They Are More Likely To Be Distributed In Their Liquid Form. 
### Storage
When Jewels Where First Adopted As Money The Primary Form Of Distribution Was As Crystals But Eventually It Was Figured Out How To Keep Them As A Liquid. This Development Was Made Into Modern Infrastructure. Wallets And Jewel-Pouches Became Enchanted Jars, The Weight-To-Value Ratio Was Calculated And Authentication Systems Where Figured Out To Make Only Jewels Work With These.
People And Races Which Are Older Or More Traditional May Prefer To Keep Jewels In Their Crystal Form Despite It Being Inconvenient.

Most Jewel Jars Have Increased Capacity, Damage Resistance And Calculative Properties Making Them A Safe And Easy Way To Carry Your Money
Places That Don't Have Jewel Jars Which Can Calculate How Much Money You Are Adding Or Removing Are Usually Paired With Scales So That The Volume (Value) Of The Jewels Can Be Measured In The Liquid Form.

More Expensive Vessels Have A Magic Array Around The Rim That Automatically Converts The Jewels From Solid To Liquid And Back Again

The Average Vessel Resembles A Mason Jar
Larger, Safe-Like Containers Are Roughly The Size And Shape Of A Fish Tank And Will Normally Have Some Sort Of Interactive System On One Face
For Travel Most People Have Either Vial Sized Jars (Which Have A Ten Platinum Capacity) Or A Water Bottle Sized Jar (With A 100 Platinum Capacity)
There Are Rarer (Still Popular) Forms Like: Potion Bottle (Same Capacity As Water Bottle), Jewellery Styled/Attached, Unlimited Capacity Ones
There Are No Forms That It Cant Take But These Are The Ones You Are Likely To See
##### Linked Storage
There Are Enchantments That Can Join Containers Making Everyone Have Access To The Same Amount Of Money Or Decide How Much Money A Specific Person Can Get
Once An Enchantment Is Cast It Cannot Be Changed


### Values
#### Bronze 
These Crystals Are Lowest Value And Will Not Get You Much. The Internal Liquid Has A Silver Appearance And Acts Like A Thick Oil
#### Silver 
Is The Second Lowest Value With A Gold Liquid Inside. This Is The First One That Clearly Shows The Unique Property Of The Jewel Juice: it Moves In An Unpredictable Manner

#### Gold 
The Second Highest VAlue. Both The Mathmatical And Cultural Middle-Ground As Far As Currency Is Concerned. The LiquidInside Looks Like Platinum And Moves The Slowest

#### Platinum 
The Highest Value And Easy To Come Accross Among SOme Cultures Or Work Sectors. The Inside Is A Thick Black Slurry And Is A Lot More Lively Than The Previous Liquids. The Seemingly Unstable Appearance Of This Liquid Is What Allowed People To First Notice The Pattern I Their Movemtnts

## ichorous
They Came from the original stars as a gift from the gods. The intent was to strengthen the bond between creatures at the point at which they were weakest and now theycan be utalised for more than just currancy.
