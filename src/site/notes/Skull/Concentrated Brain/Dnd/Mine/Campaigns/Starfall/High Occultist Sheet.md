#### Pact of the Blade

Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you attack with your pact weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

#### Pact of the Chain

Also at 1st level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.

#### Sinister Calling

Beginning at 2nd level, your deep studies of the occult have lead you to hear sinister voices that reveal to you the secrets of the dark arts.

You learn the Eldritch Blast cantrip which you can cast at will. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Pact of the Tome

The sinister voices lead you to uncover a grimoire called the Book of Shadows which binds itself to your soul. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, the sinister voices will lead you to it. The book returns to your person if it is destroyed. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Master of the Elements

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your sinister powers to manipulate the elements of nature itself. You learn the Gust, Shape Water, Mold Earth, and Control Flames cantrips and can cast them at will.

#### Eyes of the Rune Keeper

Beginning at 3rd level, you can read all writing.

#### Eldritch Smite

At 5th level, you've learned to channel your sinister powers through your weapon attacks.

As a bonus action, you can imbue your Pact Weapon with sinister energy. Until the start of your next turn, the next time you hit a creature with your Pact Weapon, you auto cast Eldritch Blast on the targeted creature. This use of Eldritch Blast produces one less beam than it would otherwise (one beam at 5th level, two beams at 11th level, and three beams at 17th level). Each beam hits the targeted creature without fail (the charisma modifier is only added to one beam).

#### Eldritch Spear

At 5th level, when you cast Eldritch Blast, its range is 300 feet.

#### Improved Sinister Calling

Beginning at 6th level, the sinister voices invade your mind at all times, including your dreams. In the process, they reveal to you deeper truths to Eldritch power.

When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast, you can apply one of the following effects:

- Move that creature in a straight line 10 feet closer to yourself
- Push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line
- Reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn

A creature can only be affected by one of these effects per turn, and only ONCE that turn.

In addition, when you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

#### Mask of Many Faces

Starting at 6th level, you can cast Disguise Self at will.
#### Eldritch Sight

Starting at 7th level, you can cast Detect Magic at will, without expending material components.

#### Devil's Sight

Also at 7th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

#### Ascendant Step

Beginning at 10th level, you can cast Levitate on yourself at will, without expending material components.

#### Master of Myriad Forms

At 11th level, you can now cast Alter Self at will.

#### Eldritch Mind

Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

#### Shroud of Shadow

Starting at 15th level, you can cast Invisibility on yourself at will.

#### Visions of Distant Realms

At 18th level, as an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

In addition, you can cast Arcane Eye at will.

#### Witch Sight

Beginning at 18th level, you gain true sight up to 120 feet.

#### Book of Ancient Secrets

At 9th level, you can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list; these rituals needn’t be from the same spell list. The spells appear in the book. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means.

On your adventures, you can add other spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than your occultist level and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

#### Aspect of the Moon

Starting at 13th level, you no longer need to sleep and can’t be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading your Book of Shadows and keeping watch.

#### Mystic Arcanum

At 17th level, you can pick one spell from any spell list and add it to your Book of Shadows. You can cast this spell without material costs. When you cast this spell, you must finish a long rest before casting this spell again. UNless you have spell slot for it in which you can cast it but must have the material needed.
