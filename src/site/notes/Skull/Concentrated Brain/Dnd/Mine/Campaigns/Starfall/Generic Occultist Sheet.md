#### Pact of the Blade

Starting at 1st level, you can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you attack with your pact weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

#### Pact of the Chain

Also at 1st level, you learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.

#### Sinister Calling

Beginning at 2nd level, your deep studies of the occult have lead you to hear sinister voices that reveal to you the secrets of the dark arts.

You learn the Eldritch Blast cantrip which you can cast at will. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Pact of the Tome

The sinister voices lead you to uncover a grimoire called the Book of Shadows which binds itself to your soul. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, the sinister voices will lead you to it. The book returns to your person if it is destroyed. The book turns to ash when you die.

#### Master of the Elements

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your sinister powers to manipulate the elements of nature itself. You learn the Gust, Shape Water, Mold Earth, and Control Flames cantrips and can cast them at will.

#### Eyes of the Rune Keeper

Beginning at 3rd level, you can read all writing.

#### Eldritch Smite

At 5th level, you've learned to channel your sinister powers through your weapon attacks.

As a bonus action, you can imbue your Pact Weapon with sinister energy. Until the start of your next turn, the next time you hit a creature with your Pact Weapon, you auto cast Eldritch Blast on the targeted creature. This use of Eldritch Blast produces one less beam than it would otherwise (one beam at 5th level, two beams at 11th level, and three beams at 17th level). Each beam hits the targeted creature without fail (the charisma modifier is only added to one beam).

#### Eldritch Spear

At 5th level, when you cast Eldritch Blast, its range is 300 feet.

#### Improved Sinister Calling

Beginning at 6th level, the sinister voices invade your mind at all times, including your dreams. In the process, they reveal to you deeper truths to Eldritch power.

When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast, you can apply one of the following effects:

- Move that creature in a straight line 10 feet closer to yourself
- Push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line
- Reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn

A creature can only be affected by one of these effects per turn, and only ONCE that turn.

In addition, when you cast Eldritch Blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

#### Mask of Many Faces

Starting at 6th level, you can cast Disguise Self at will.
