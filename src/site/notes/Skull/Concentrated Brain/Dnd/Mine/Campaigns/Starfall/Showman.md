~When a creature starts it's turn, as a reaction you view the actions of a single creature you can see through the influences of the stars, and you read what is written there. The target creature makes a Charisma saving throw, on a failure you can predict that creature's actions. This has the following effects: You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. For every 5 feet the creature moves, you can move 5 feet (up to your normal movement) on the creature's turn when it has completed its movement. You can warn yourself and allies that can hear you of the target's offensive intentions; any creature targeted by the target's next attack gains a +2 bonus to AC or on its saving throw against that attack. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

~As an action you tap into the life force of a creature that is capable of performing legendary Actions. When you cast the spell, the target creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to take legendary Actions for the spell's Duration. A creature can't use legendary Resistance to automatically succeed on the saving throw against this spell. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, regaining 1 legendary Action on a success. It continues repeating the saving throw for 1 hour or it regains all its legendary Actions.

~As an action you and up to 3 other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you can see the flickering shadows of fate a few seconds into the future. When the spell is cast, all other Creatures within 90 feet of you make Wisdom Saving Throws. Those that fail must declare, in Initiative order, what their next Action will be. You and your effected allies declare your Actions last, after hearing what all other Creatures will do. All creatures that declared an Action must follow their declarations as closely as possible when their turn comes. Until the start of your next turn, you and your affected allies have advantage on Attack rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws, and Creatures that declared their Action have disadvantage on attacks against them.

Once you have used one of the effects of this feature you may not use that same effect again till you complete a long rest.
