# Characteristics 
Starlight skin. As a bonus action you can choose to emit dim light in a 15ft radius 
Astral heritage: as a reaction  when you are targeted by a projectile you can use your faint psionic power to roll a d8 and lower the damage dealt, if the damage reaches 0 you can make a ranged attack roll against the attacker instead with the projectile 
Starry eyes: you are 

#### Feature: Provider

During a long rest you are able to find enough food for yourself and your proficiency bonus number of people for a day. You can do so and still gain the benefits of a rest, but still must sleep or trance as appropriate to your race or lineage. Additionally, you have twice your proficiency bonus for your Stealth or Survival skill gained from this Background when in natural surroundings. This bonus does not stack with Expertise or similar rules at any time.

#### Curse of the Fursuit

The fursuit on your body has made you unable to live the way you once did. As a result, you lose all action and attack-based, AC-affecting, and flight-related features exclusive to your race, but you retain ability score increases, passive traits, walking, swimming, and/or burrowing speed, size, and languages. For example, if your species was a white dragonborn, you would lose your breath weapon, but you would retain your resistance to cold damage and your strength and charisma score increases.

#### Claws of the Furry

No matter what species your fursuit is based on, it has a set of razor-sharp claws on its hands and feet. Whenever you make an unarmed strike, you deal 1d4 + your strength Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus slashing (rather than bludgeoning) damage. This slashing damage cannot incite Bleeding (unless _Goring Strike_ is activated; see below)

#### Fursuit Defense

Your fursuit grows with you, always fitting snugly around your body. To the touch, it feels warm and alive as skin does. However, it is still a costume, made of fabrics and hard frames. Starting at level 1, while unarmored and not carrying ashield, your AC is equal to 10 + your charisma Modifier + your wisdom Modifier (this is overwritten by _Sturdy Scales_ if you belong to the Reptile Kingdom, see below).

#### Fur Points

Starting at level 2, you gain the system of Fur Points. You have a number of Fur Points equal to your level, as show in the Fur Points column of the Furry table (see above). At level 2, you have 2 abilities you can spend these on: _Fur-ious Blows_ and _Ferocious Howl_ (see below). You regain all Fur Points you have used when you complete a long rest.

#### Fur-ious Blows

The primal nature of the curse has begun to surface upon you. As a result, you begin to become more feral in your combat style. Starting at level 2, whenever you make an unarmed strike (see above), you can spend X Fur Point(s) to make X number of unarmed strikes as a part of the same Attack action, where X is the number of Fur Points you spent.

#### Ferocious Howl

Your animalistic cry is a sound to behold. Starting at level 2, you can spent 2 Fur Points to use your action to target 1 creature of your choice that can hear you. You can choose to empower them, allowing them to roll an extra 1d6 of the damage type their attack deals (if it deals more than 1 type of damage, the target chooses which damage receives the extra d6) on all Attack actions they take during the damage step. Alternatively, you can incite terror. The target must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or become [Frightened](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_SRD:Conditions#Frightened "5e SRD:Conditions") for 1 minute. Your _Ferocious Howl_ will sound like the call of the animal your fursuit is designed to resemble. For example, a fursuit designed in the likeness of a bird of prey would let loose a mighty "_ca-caw!_", and a catlike fursuit wearer would roar.

#### Furry Kingdom

Although your fursuit has always been modeled after a certain animal, at level 3, new abilities unlock depending on what Kingdom it belongs to. Your costume belongs to either _Mammal_, _Reptilian_, or _Avian_, all detailed below. You gain a new ability for your chosen Furry Kingdom at level 3, 6, 10, 14, and 18.

#### Scent Tracking
Your specially built costume nose drastically gains sensitivity as if it was your true nose. As a result, starting at level 3, you can spend 3 Fur Points to identify how many creatures are in a 20-foot radius of you, as well as their general location. If you have met or interacted with any of these specific creatures before, you know who or what they are. If you have seen their species or race before, you also know what species or they are. You can activate this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier. You regain this feature after you complete a short or long rest. 

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack

Starting at level 5, you can take the Attack action twice during your turn. At level 11 you can take three Attack actions, and at level 18, you can take four.
#### Pounce
You hone a pouncing claw technique with your mammalian nature. Starting at level 6, as an Attack, you can spend 3 Fur Points to pounce onto them with your claws, inflicting 2d6 bludgeoning damage + 1d8 slashing damage + your Strength Modifier (does not incite Bleeding). The target must succeed on a Strength (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics). If you succeed, the target is pushed back 10 feet and is knocked Prone. If you fail, the target is pushed back 5 feet and is not knocked Prone. This attack does not count as an unarmed strike. 

#### One with the Beasts

Other wild beasts begin to see you as an animal, not a humanoid, and begin treating you as such. Starting at level 7, you can understand animals. They cannot speak directly to you, nor can you to an animal, but you can sense their emotions and understand messages they are trying to convey. If an animal is of the same kingdom as your Furry Kingdom (see above), it will become friendly toward you. Your DM decides which animals fall under these Kingdoms.
