## T-Minus One

That Day When The Stars Came Falling. A Moment Revered Throughout All Of History. 
 "Almost As It Were From A Dream. Nothing More, Nothing Less Than A Beautiful View."

  
  

Or At Least That's How The Saying Goes. 

Unfortunately, None Of You Are Any Where Near Old Enough To Remember That Day But The Legend Tells Of Bright Nights, Dancing Stars And The Fear Of A World Ending Calamity That Never Came.

Although (Or Maybe Because) The Legends Sound So Fanciful, Or Perhaps Its The Way That They Have Been Passed Down Through Generations Most People Doubt Any Of It Can Really Be True.

Almost Seventeen-Hundred Years Later, On The Night Of The Celebration Of The Moons And The Stars, You Look Into The Night Sky And You Start To Wonder If You Are The Ones Who Are Wrong.
Lost In The Moment You See Shooting Stars Bright Enough, Large Enough, Frequent Enough To Turn The Sky From A Midnight Blue To A Flushed Turquoise.
The Only Way You Can Be Sure It Isn't Day Is Through The Occasional Glimpses You Get Of The Moons Breaking Through The Light Of The Celestial Bodies Which Surround It.

You've Been Invited Or Dragged Or Somehow Drawn To An Event That Seems To Be In Celebration Of These Stars And In Remembrance Of The Calamity
There's Food, Music, Performances And According To Rumours The Queen And Her Heir Will Be Making An Appearance
