From Somewhere In The Vacinity Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Realities/Kawshekh/Location/Planets/Harmony/Regions/Gahenna/Gahenna\|Gahenna]]

went [festival] to preform as a magician to make money


yea i was thinking of playing a realm hopper (again because realm hopper fun) who is from a realm where she was in a war of humans against devils [so a universe where the blood war spilled over to the material plane] eventually they found a magic item that could end the war but needing two sacrifices, it would kill the devils but would also kill the humans, seeing it as a greater good cause the blood war would rip the realm apart if left to run wild she accepted the conditions and both races were killed, the device would also then after confirming the war was over warp her to this realm, id say shes been here around a year, she is a wizard that poses as a magician (something i wanna do is every spell i cast i need to get stage magic materials, for example using flash paper to cast a firebolt or using a top hat to use presdigitation and pull something from it)

since she has been in the land around a year now i was thinking for the town she ended up in originally for it to have a strange qwerk with it, a graveyard that you can hear the whispers of the dead, normally avoided by most the townsfolk, but when she would go down there she could hear her people during the war, making her paranoid that their spirits were within this realm following her, other than that i was thinking she was took in by a family while she got on her feet, a simple farmer family, while living with them she studied has to transmute her magical style into the magician (what she is still trying until level 2 where she gets there) about 1 month before session she left the town to travel,seek redemption and make her own way in the world

able to pull out lolipops whenever she wants

i want her new family to have basically fabricated/staged that she is a product of the reincarnation church and it just went a bit weird and thats why she doesn't actually know much about the world like her way of explaining why it seems she has been here for a year or two so she normally goes to each church of them she finds and leaves a offering mostly just to keep her lie going but also as a 'your cool have this'

Okay First Question Is How Much Will She Actually Know About The Church
id say more than a surface level
like enough where she could give trivia
but not all that much
compared to a cleric

Other Than Genocide Cube Explicitly Having Dragged You There, Theres No Reason Why You Couldnt Have Been Reincarnated

YoU Can Get Away With This In Your Home Town, You "Were" Reincarnated From Another World, Couple Found You And Took You In (They Claim They Always Wanted Another Member Of The Family But Arent Too Fond Of Kids), You All Realised/Found Out That You Were A Product Of The Church, You Tell Everyone Nearby (And Since There Isnt A Close Church Nobody Would Question It)

Outside Of Your Hometown People Might Know More About The Process But Less About You The Obvious Problems Are: You Werent Actually Reincarnated Because You Didnt Die, The Church (If It Did Bring Someone From Another World) Wouldnt Spawn You In Just Anywhere, Whatever The Actual Family History Is Before The Lie, _How_ You Got To "Church" Is Up To You, And How You Interact With Church Stuff In Your Downtime Needs To Not Come Off As Too Religeous Or Indifferent

Oh Obviously If Theres Information You Wanna Know I'll Tell You Or Ill Say If I Think Its Not Something Youd Have Looked Into

yea i want to have qutes act fairly broadley with most things, since she knows the lie crumbles under a decent amount of scrutiny

still gonna have her not exactly like infernal blooded things like tieflings but shes still cogntiive enough to know tieflings aren't bad just cause of their blood (hell its obvious to anyone that tieflings were slave  fighters in the blood war anyway)
but im gonna  have her be really into ocultisim and ritualistic practices, to hunt actual full demons/devils
like learning rituals to banish them, salt barriers, holy water type stuff

alright so proposed retcon, since grim has her secret group character ari be a inverse of her main group character kym i was thinking to have karma be the inverse of qutes, since we had it so when qutes used the cube and it wiped out her realms life but her and a single demon got warped through maybe karma could be that demon (so retconning her to be a cambion deal maker warlock) so like how ari is basically a evil couterpart to kym, karma would be the oposite side of the coin to qutes
