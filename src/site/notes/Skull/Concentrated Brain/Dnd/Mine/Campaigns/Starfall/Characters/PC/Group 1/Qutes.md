From Somewhere In The Vacinity Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Realities/Kawshekh/Location/Planets/Harmony/Regions/Gahenna/Gahenna\|Gahenna]]
 
Went To  The Moon Festival to preform as a magician to make money


realm hopper who is from a realm where she was in a war of humans against devils [so a universe where the blood war spilled over to the material plane] eventually they found a magic item that could end the war but needing two sacrifices, it would kill the devils but would also kill the humans, seeing it as a greater good cause the blood war would rip the realm apart if left to run wild she accepted the conditions and both races were killed, the device would also then after confirming the war was over warp her to this realm, id say shes been here around a year, she is a wizard that poses as a magician 

every spell needs stage magic materials

since she has been in the land around a year now  the town she ended up in originally has a strange quirk, a graveyard that you can hear the whispers of the dead, normally avoided by most the townsfolk, but when she would go down there she could hear her people during the war, making her paranoid that their spirits were within this realm following her

she was took in by a family while she got on her feet, a simple farmer family, while living with them she studied has to transmute her magical style into the magician 

about 1 month before session she left the town to travel,seek redemption and make her own way in the world

able to pull out lolipops whenever she wants

new family to has staged that she is a product of the reincarnation church and it just went a bit weird and thats why she doesn't actually know much about the world (her way of explaining why it seems she has been here for a year or two) so she normally goes to each church of them she finds and leaves a offering mostly just to keep her lie going but also as a 'your cool have this'

Okay First Question Is How Much Will She Actually Know About The Church
Knows more than a surface level Information About [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Dnd/Mine/Beliefs/The Church Of Second Chances\|The Church Of Second Chances]]
she could give trivia but not all that much compared to a cleric

Other Than Genocide Cube Explicitly Having Dragged Her There, Theres No Reason Why She Couldnt Have Been Reincarnated

Can Get Away With This In Gahenna, 
Was "Reincarnated" From Another World, Couple Found You And Took You In (They Claim They Always Wanted Another Member Of The Family But Arent Too Fond Of Kids), Then They All Realised/Found Out That She Was A Product Of The Church, They  Tell Everyone Nearby (And Since There Isnt A Church Close To The Family Nobody Really Questions It)

Outside (And Within Central) Gahenna People Might Know More About The Process But Less About Qutes 
The Obvious Problems Are: 
- She Wasnt Actually Reincarnated Because She Didnt Die
- The Church (If It Did Bring Someone From Another World) Wouldnt Spawn Her In Just Anywhere
- Whatever The Actual Family History Is Before The Lie
- How She Interacts With Church Stuff In Her Downtime Needs To Not Come Off As Too Religious Or Indifferent

Qutes act fairly broadley with most things, since she knows the lie crumbles under a decent amount of scrutiny

Does not exactly like infernal blooded things like tieflings but shes still cogntiive enough to know tieflings aren't bad just cause of their blood (its obvious to anyone that tieflings were slave  fighters in the blood war anyway)
She Is really into ocultisim and ritualistic practices, to hunt actual full demons/devils
like learning rituals to banish them, salt barriers, holy water type stuff

Karma Is the inverse of qutes, 
when qutes used the cube and it wiped out her realms life but her and a single demon got warped through
