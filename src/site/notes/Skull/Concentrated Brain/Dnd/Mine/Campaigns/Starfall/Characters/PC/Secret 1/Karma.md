Karma Is the inverse of qutes, when qutes used the cube and it wiped out her realms life but her and a single demon got warped through
would be the oposite side of the coin to qutes

She could be Pretending To Be from a family that is pretty honorable, like knights or something like that, pretty prestigious/pious people
so there is a big visual divide between the history of her family and what karma is
also showing that her lifestyle is a choice, she wasn't pushed into this, she actively chooses to work in such a vile sector
