**Safe** Map Traversal:
	Following Road:
		Walk: Hexagon = 4 Days
		Run: Hexagon = 2 Days
		Carriage: Hexagon = 1 Days
		Car: Hexagon = ½ Days
		Boat: Hexagon= 1 Day
	Off-Road: 
	Walk: Hexagon = 8 Days
		Run: Hexagon = 6 Days
		Carriage: Hexagon = 3 Days
		Car: Hexagon = 2 Days
		Boat: Hexagon= 1 Day

General Idea Is At Least Two (Maybe A Secret Third) Groups Going Around The World Hopefully Not Fucking Each Other Over
Lining The Days Up So If You Do Have An Impact On Each Other You Can React Accordingly
