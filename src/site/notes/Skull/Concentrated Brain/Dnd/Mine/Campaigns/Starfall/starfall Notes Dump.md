General Idea Is At Least Two (Maybe A Secret Third) Groups Going Around The World Hopefully Not Fucking Each Other Over

There Is A Roll Option
Everyone Gets A Thingâ„¢
Most Homebrew Is Allowed (Ask First)
Ask At Least One Question About What Youre Getting Yourself Into
Feel Free To Invite People But They're Your Responsibility (Ill Explain What That Means Later)
Have Fun
Also If Something Has A Material Cost You Can Instead Just Lose Twice The Money

Names Thing
