# <center><span style="color:#F007FE">Cult Of Violets</span></center>
(Controversial) 




	
# Beliefs
A Cult That Believes In The God Of Sacrifice And Concord And In Inflicting Small Amounts Of Pain To Lower The Maximum Suffering Possible For An Individual To Experience

## Church Goal:
The True Prophet Of The Church Would Be Entirely Selfless And Become The New God Of Sacrifice And Concord Alongside The Current God Of Doom Who Runs The Church In  His Absence
## Controversial?
They Believe In A Breathing God That Hasn't Been Seen In Any Recent History. Some Retort That The God They Preach Is Not Omnipotent Within Their Domains.
### The God Of Doom
The God Of Doom Is The Force Behind All Of The Peoples' Misfortunes. He Inflicts Suffering Mostly To His Own Chagrin, Having To Maintain The Balance Between The Enjoyable And Painful Parts Of Life. 
The Church Worships The (Absent) God Of Sacrifice And Concord By Easing His Burden Through Practices Like The Violet Vulneration.

# The Taboos Of The C Of V
The Biggest Taboo In The Cult Is Perversion. Increasing The Average Corruption In The World Is Antithetical To The Cult Doctrines, The Best Retribution A Defiler Can Hope For Is To Be Exiled For Eternity.

# The Social Organisation And Initiations Of The C Of V
Rarely Upper Class Though There Is Nothing Forbidding Anyones Entry, Just Need To Have The Love Of The Game
To Be A Member Of The Cult Of Violets One Must Maintain The Virtues They Hold Dear Above All But The Diversion Of Malice. There Are No Prerequisite Qualifications For Undergoing The Cyanosis Ritual But Breaking Tenet Following The Ritual Inexorably Results In The Doom Of The Blue Blood. 

Events Following The Cyanosis Ritual Are Governed By Feeling. Though It Isn't Unusual For The Faction To Have A Welcome Party.

# Places Of Worship In The C Of V
*The Fields*, Gladiatorial Arenas, Temples

# Rituals In The C Of V
Cult Rituals Include The Violet Vulneration, Floristry, Conflict Reporting, Blood Face-Paint, Cyanosis, Carnal Sanguination, Flower Crowns, Composting
Usually Masochists

### The Violet Vulneration
Can Take Place Anywhere As Long As One Of The Floriferous Are Present. The Twin Bloods Mix And The Flowers Rise. The Rest Of The Ritual Is Directed By Feeling Over Doctrine 
### Cyanosis
An Indoctrination Ritual That Takes Place In *The Fields*. The New Recruit Will Place The Heads Of Violets Along Their Cardiovascular Or Meridian Systems (Often Aided By Members Of The C Of V). If Aligned, The Violets Will Be Absorbed Into Their Body Leaving Pierced Holes Behind Where The Stems Were, Allowing The Red Blood To Drain Out And The Purple Blood To Perpetuate Itself. Creatures Without Blood Will Be Gifted It Without Their Physiology Being Affected.
## Carnal Sanguination
A Ritual Carried Out When A Member Is Believed To Be Floriferous Where Said Member And Their Peers Receive Countless Wounds From The Petals Of *The Fields*, Bleeding Out. Without Impurities, The Peers Will Pass Out And After A Breath The New Floriferant Focal Point's Blood Will Radiate A Ruby Red Glow While Their New Power Settles.
All Of The Floriferous Have Red Blood Visible Through Their Skin

# Prayers
It Hurts Me-It Hurts Me Not, Endless Waters Of Exsanguination Feel My Sorrow Accept My Offering And Brighten Tomorrow,
