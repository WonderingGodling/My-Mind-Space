# Preface

If you're reading this then I'm assuming that you are somewhat aware of either Richard or piscology itself since Richard’s influence does reach outside of piscologiclly educated, however, I will nonetheless provide you with a brief explanation. Our world is large. Our reality is, of course, larger. Although we do not yet know how our world came to be, disregarding the “retcon” theorem, we do know for almost certain how our reality became what it is now.

  

Richard. I’d call him a great man but the use of either word would be criminally underselling his existence. As a High Sea Man and an astrozoologist, I have been referring to him as “Richard” while his true name is of course Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life. He is also known as “Big Dick”.  Although I am no longer affiliated with the field of astrozoology for quite some time I'm still qualified to teach it.

  

Before it gets complicated I’ll relay the basics. Richard is, other than religiously, the leading explanation for how reality came to be. A large fish-like creature who has been split and dispersed throughout everything that we know. A being who gave its life for us so that we all may exist.

  

Many things remained unknown about Big Dick, including its gender and desires. Yet it is believed that he may have gone by he/it pronouns. The piscologists and zoologists have sent sky vessels off the edge of our world to try to discover such information but those experiments have only resulted in failure.

  

I apologise for any complicated sentences that follow; I felt like this should be more accessible however I'm not too good at writing in common. Sadly, some intricacies do get lost in translation.

# Piscology

Piscology describes how our reality erupted from Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life (Aka. Big Dick). It is the prevailing philosophical model explaining the evolution of the observable reality from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-Fish-scale form. Piscology offers a comprehensive explanation for a rather broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of Dick's Gift Caviar, the Big Dick Energy, and the sizeable Fish-Scale structure.

  

Crucially, Piscology is compatible with the observation that the farther away everything is, the faster it is moving away from us. An exponential increase in the reality that we know absconding is something that couldn't be left unobserved.  Extrapolating Big Dick's Eruption backwards in time, Piscology describes an increasingly concentrated existence preceded by a Swim Bladder in which what we know loses meaning (typically named "Big Dick's Swim Bladder"). Detailed measurements of The Eruption Rate of our reality places Big Dick's Swim Bladder at an estimated 13.787 ± 0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of our reality.

  

After its initial Eruption, an event that is, by itself, often referred to as "Big Dick's Eruption", our reality cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of Cosmic Caviar. Giant clouds of this primordial Caviar later coalesced through the gravity generated by Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life, forming early Celestials, Mephistophelians and realities, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides this primordial Caviar, Piscologists observe the gravitational effects of unknown Fish Carcas surrounding realities. The residue left behind by Richard. Most of the gravitational potential in our reality seems to be in this form, and Piscology (and various observations) indicate that this excess gravitational potential was not created by Celestials, such as Gaia: the supposed embodiment of the conception of worlds. 

  

A Piscologist who went by the name of Georges Lemaître, first noted in 1927 that an Erupting reality could easily be traced back in time to an originating single point (Big Dick’s Bladder).

For several decades, the Pysologist community was divided between supporters of Big Dick's Eruption and the rival steady-state model which both offered explanations for the observed Eruption, but the steady-state model stipulated an eternal reality in contrast to Big Dick's Eruption's finite age. In 1964, Big Dick Energy was discovered, which convinced many Piscologists that the steady-state theory was falsified, since, unlike the steady-state theory, the Hot Dick's Eruption predicted uniform Big Dick Energy throughout our reality caused by the high gifts and densities in the distant past. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favours Big Dick's Eruption, which is now essentially universally accepted.

  

# Beliefs of Piscology

Piscology offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of Caviar, Big Dick Energy and large-Fish-scale structure. 

  
  

## Dick’s Eruption

The Eruption of our reality was inferred from early twentieth-century Piscological observations and is an essential ingredient of Piscology. Big Dick's Eruption is not an Eruption of Fish Remnants moving outward to fill an empty reality. Instead, Dick itself Erupts with time everywhere and increases the physical distances between comoving points. In other words, Big Dick's Eruption is not an Eruption in Dick, but rather an Eruption of Dick. However, local concentrations of Fish Remnants such as our reality do not necessarily Erupt at the same speed as the whole of reality.

  

## Horizons

An important feature of Big Dick's Eruption reality is the presence of Caviar horizons. Since our reality has a finite age, and Dick's Gift travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past for whom Dick's Gift has not yet had time to reach. This places a limit or a past horizon on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because Dick is Erupting, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, Dick's Gift emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a future horizon, which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. 

Our understanding of our reality back to very early times suggests that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of our reality at early times. So our view cannot extend further backwards in time, though the horizon recedes in Dick. If the Eruption of our reality continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.

  

## Climaxization

Some processes in the early reality occurred too slowly, compared to the Eruption rate of our reality, to reach approximate Climactic equilibrium. Others were fast enough to reach Climaxization. The parameter usually used to find out whether a process in the very early reality has reached Climactic equilibrium is the ratio between the rate of the process (usually the rate of collisions between Caviar). The larger the ratio, the more time Caviar has to Climaxize before they were too far away from each other.

  
  

## Timeline

According to Piscology, reality at the beginning was very hot and very compact, and since then it has been Erupting and cooling down.

  

### Big Dick's Swim Bladder

Extrapolation of the Eruption of reality backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and gift at a finite time in the past. This irregular behaviour, known as the gravitational effect of Big Dick's Swim Bladder, indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward Big Dick's Swim Bladder.

  

The primordial Big Dick's Swim Bladder is itself sometimes called "Dick's Eruption", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase of reality. In either case, "Dick's Eruption" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "Conception" of our reality since it represents the point in history where reality can be verified to have entered into a regime as we understand it.

  

Despite being extremely dense at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a black hole—reality did not re-collapse into Big Dick's Swim Bladder. Since the early reality did not immediately collapse into a multitude of black holes, Fish Remnants at that time must have been very evenly distributed.

  

### Dick’s acceleration

Independent lines of evidence imply that reality today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as Cuck Energy, which permeates all of Dick. The observations suggest that 73% of the total energy density of today's reality is in this form. When reality was very young, it was likely infused with Cuck Energy, but with less Dick and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly breaking the Eruption. But eventually, after numerous billion years of Eruption, the declining density of Fish Remnants relative to the density of Cuck Energy caused the Eruption of Dick to slowly begin to accelerate.

  

Cuck Energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the Piscological constant, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and chaotic.

  
  

## Observational evidence

"The Eruption picture is too firmly grounded in data from every area to be proved invalid in its general features."

  

### Lawrence Trout

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory is the Eruption of reality, discovery and measurement of Big Dick Energy and the relative abundance of Dick's Gift produced by an Eruption. 

  

Precise modern models of Dick's Eruption appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of Piscology. Of these features, Cuck Fish Remnants is currently the subject of most active investigations. Cuck Energy is also an area of intense interest for Piscologists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of Cuck Energy will be possible.

  

### The Eruption of Dick

Observations of distant realities and quasars show that these objects are Gifted:  Dick's Gift emitted from them has been shot to further distances. 

That Dick is undergoing metric Eruption is shown by direct observational evidence of the Piscological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Piscological Gifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Piscological principle that reality looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the Gifts were the result of an Eruption from a centre distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

  

Big Dick Energy from Dick's Eruption was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout reality. Uniform cooling of the Big Dick Energy over billions of years is explainable only if reality is experiencing a metric Eruption, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique centre of an Eruption.

  

### Big Dick Energy

In Eruption Piscology the “Big Dick Energy” is electromagnetic Big Dick Energy that is a remnant from an early stage of reality, also known as "Relic Big Dick Energy". The Big Dick Energy is faint Big Dick Energy filling all Dick. It is an important source of data on the early reality because it is the oldest electromagnetic Big Dick Energy, in reality, dating to the epoch of recombination when the first Fish Remnants were formed. With a telescope, the Dick between Celestials and realities is completely Cuck.

  

Big Dick Energy is landmark evidence of Dick's Eruption origin of reality. When reality was young, before the formation of Celestials and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with an opaque fog. This is the source of the alternative term relic Big Dick Energy. The surface of the last scattering refers to the set of points in Dick at the right distance from us.

  
  
  
  
  

### Other lines of evidence

The age of reality as estimated from the Big Dick Energy is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest Celestials. It is also in good agreement with age estimates based on measurements of the Eruption and measurements of gift fluctuations in the Big Dick Energy. 

  
  
  
  
  

# The End Times In Accordance To Piscology

Before observations of Cuck Energy, Piscologists considered two scenarios for the future of reality. If the mass density of reality were greater than the critical density, then reality would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it Celestialted—a Big Cuck.

  

Alternatively, if the density in reality were equal to or below the critical density, the Eruption would slow down but never stop. Celestial formation would cease with the consumption of Gift in each reality; Celestials would burn up. The average Gift within reality would very gradually asymptotically approach zero.

  

Other explanations of Cuck Energy suggest that ultimately reality clusters, Celestials, planets and Fish Remnants will be torn apart by the ever-increasing Eruption in a so-called Clusterfuck.

  

## The Cuck

The Big Cuck is a hypothetical scenario for the ultimate fate of reality, in which the Eruption in reality eventually reverses and reality recollapses potentially followed by a reformation of reality with another Dick Eruption. 

  
  

### Summary

The Big Cuck scenario hypothesised that the density of Cuck Energy throughout reality will be sufficiently high so that Cuck attraction will overcome the Eruption which began with Dick's Eruption. 

  

# The Taboos Of Piscology

  

There are not many taboos present in Piscology but the ones that are, are heavily enforced. Piscologists, generally, don’t take kindly to when “one of their own” acts against the covenant.

  

One of the biggest taboos one can violate is blasphemy or sacrilege. Richard is, of course, the most beloved figure in Pisciology and is therefore treated with the utmost respect regardless of the situation. Anybody who insinuates a negative statement, uses offensive names or language, questions or insults Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life is ultimately seen as an enemy of Pisciology as a whole.

  

Of course, fireworks are also taboo under the creaion proclamation which clearly states that any and all mock and/or man made eplosions can be considered creational blasphemy. Any Piscologist who sets off any form of eplosion will be considered an enemy of the church and possibly hunted for sport.

  
  

Tax evasion , should be avoided. I shouldnt have to explain why.

  

# The Social Organisation And Initiations Of Piscology

There is a large range of people who end up becoming an esteemed piscologist as there are no limits to race, gender, species or class. Anybody who is smart enough to understand the words written in this book inherently has the right to become on of our many members. 

  

Regarding trends in the membership, a slight majority (34% compared to the second largest group of 30%) belongs to many of the famous patrons of theatre and trade whom shall remain anonymous.

  

If one wishes to become a Piscologist, it is imperative that they first follow any customs listed in this book for at least a week as to show the distributors of the title that you are serious and fully intend to help bring Dick’s gift to the world and (much like he did onto himself) spread his power.

  

On the morning of iniciation the initiator will make his way to your house (or other form of residance) and get you to swear an oath that is usually customised for your situation. Upon having sworn this oath you will be granted an official Piscologist Madalion that can be used as identification within the community. The ███ garments and rest of the ceramony that will then proceed have been delibrately not mentioned as to allow you the true experience upon being initiated.

  

# Places Of Worship In Piscology

There are many Churches Of Piscology (or CoPs) spread internationally, with very few cthings in common. The entrance is always arched with a silvery, polished marble and there is always a house-sized fish utopia in the middle as Humongous Richard wouled have wished. However the styl;e of architecture, the size and even the purpose of the CoPs cannot be garunteed to fit your purpose. If in a scenario where your local CoP does not support your needs or (Dick forbid turn on you for a reason not backed by the true meaning of piscology) your best hope is to go running to another CoP and hoping that they will be able to help you in your endevours.

  

# Rituals In Piscology

On the first day of each of the four months, every Piscologist must make thier way to their local CoP and spend the day socialising with either humanoid or piscatory members of the church. 

  

Every firstday members can gather near the fish-utopia at any church available for the weekly sacrifices and offerings.

  

# Prayers In Piscology

While it is expected that you pray to Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life it is not necessarily required of you. As true believers in Big Dick and what he has done for us Piscologists find importance in displaying our gratitude but also understand that one who would go through such lengths for a universe that is yet to exist doesnt require praise.

# Sacrifices In Piscology

Every firstday a ceramonial sacrificing of non-aquatic piscivores (Halions) takes place to demonstrate to Gargantuan Richard, The Superposed Fish In The Sky, Mightiest Of Space, Creator Of Life that we are willing to go the distance to serve him. Doing so, of course, grants us with many blessings which manifest in unforeseen ways and at random intervals, so the more one sacrifices per week, the higher their chance of very quickly receiving a  more than favourable blessing from Big Dick. 

  

# Monuments In Piscology

As you have most likely seen by now, there are Richardian Pillars in the vacinity of any location deemed to be important to Piscology. If you havent been lucky enough to come across one of these pillars: they are an accurate dipiction of Big Dick streatching off into the heavens and exploding over the vacinity (fish oil spread across the sky and suspended against any external force), the words “explodin time” written at the base of some of the Richardian Pillars as a refernce to both how he did, in fact, explode time and the fact that all Richardian Pillars are actually unable to age.
