# <center><span style="color:#F00000">My Mother: A Failure In Three Acts Part Who Gives A Fuck (I Know She Doesnt)</span></center>

Finally Snapped And Decided To Make This Shit Public Because Im Actually Fully And Completely Done With Her
I Dont Know Why She Thinks She Deserves Any Respect From Anybody
Case And Point: i Just Tried To Explain To Her Why She Should Listen To My Brother Instead Of Just Yelling At Him (For Stuff He Didnt Do (I Only Got To The Lsiten Part, The Rest Was Too Complicated)) And Instead Of Listen To A Word I Said She Threw A Literal Tantrum
She Jumped Up And Down, Screaming What Started As "I Dont Want To Talk" (Those Of You With Two Brain Cells Will Remember The Only Word Id Said So Far Was "Listen") But Devolved Into Unintelligible Screeching Which Ive Never Heard From Someone Over The Age Of Eight.

Dont Worry Theres So Much More For [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Say About The Asshole So This'll Be Updated
Also Her Names At The Top Because I Want Everyone To Know This Isnt Some Hypothetical Mother, This Is A Mentally Abusive Piece Of Shit That I Live With Every Day

For The Record (My Record) This Was Created On 334,23 Which Was Supposed To Be A Good Day For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Ive Spoken To Her Twice This Week (48,23)
The First Time I Didnt Appreciate The Way She Villainized [[Branches/Me\|Me]] And The Second Time Was Just 
And You Know What? I Bet She Didnt Even Fucking Notice!
Shes Never Given A Fuck About [[Branches/Me\|Me]] And Everyone Knows It

(This Next Bit Is Imported)
She Said She Doesnt Care
Then Changed Her Mind
Then Was A Prick About Us Not Having Ordered Allready
So Fuck Her She Can Have The Chicken Balti
If We Dont Pick Up When She Calls Us Its A Crime
But When She Doesnt Pick Up We Shouldnt Be Looking Out For Her In The First Place

## The Top

I Dont Know What Im Writing And None Of This Matters 
This Is Just Like A Brain Dump For Non-specific And Super Short Ideas That Havent Earned Their Own Page Yet 
Maybe Things Go Here Because Im Tired 
Maybe Im Just Bored And My Brain Said "Hey!" So I Put It Here

### Original Random Bulk

Back On My Incremental Grind For A Bit

The Lightless Flame Is Such A Badass Name

I Just Wanna Watch A Movie 
Whyve You Gotta Be A Pain In The Ass

You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout? 
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] 
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Party Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Comedy Show Im Going To Instead

ETA: I Did Show Up To The End, Saw Some Old Friends

And Yeah.... I Did Forget About This

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country 
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc) 
But Its Still Horrendous 
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research 
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both 
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Back To Random

Also I Miss My [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Sunshine/Vie\|Vie]]
We Need To Talk More

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation 
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Branches/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves 
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

### Randomness :3

I Dont Get This Library 
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything

I Got To My Class And There Already [[Branches/People\|People]] There (ETA: Not My [[Branches/People\|People]] Other [[Branches/People\|People]])

First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two 
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination 
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

### Public Transport Rant (Train Edition)

The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im NeveR Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks 
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool 
Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train 
I Know All This Its All Goo 
The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed 
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like • _ • 
Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know 
Thats The Train I Got On

Ive Got More Things To Do Than I Have Time To Sleep But Tomorrow I Have Things To Do So Its Time To Sleep?

I Didnt Sleep I Messed With The Laptop

I Ran Out Of Data 
Spotify Was Using Automatic Quality

I Was Gonna Read On The Train But I Still Dont Trust Them

So Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Thoughts]], None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation 
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful 
Its Tuesday 
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void 
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

## Sneaky Imports

I Dissociated In And Out Of My Death And Missed The Premier But This Is So Good

Short Version: Remembered One Of My Friends Knows Someone With An Armpit Fetish And Im Wondering How You Know You Have An Armpit Fetish 
Like What Steps Do You Have To Take To Know Its Specifically That 
I Just Feel Like "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Part" Is Too Specific 
I Figured It Out! 
Watching Someone Change In The Gym And Youre Staring At Them For Ages 
Then You Go "Im Only Staring At Their Armpits...." 
Then You Go [[Explicitly Showcased/Home Page I Guess/Home Page\|Home]] And Figure It Out From There 
Its Just That I Can Imagine Someone Finding Bdsm Porn And Being Like "I Want More Of This" 
But Does Armpit Porn Even Exist?

You should see

I Was Gonna Say "Im [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Okay\|Okay]])" But When Have I Ever Not Been Curious Of The Top Ten Images Three Of Them Have Actual Armpits As A Focus Almost All Of Pornhubs Results Are Just Other Porn But Also Armpits Exist But Theres A Few Videos Of [[Branches/People\|People]] Licking Them And One Video Titled "Armpit Joi" So I Guess Its Straight Up Not A Thing

## So Anyway

There's Some Of The Stuff I Didnt Add

Gonna Make A [[Explicitly Showcased/From Others/Quotes\|Quotes]] Thing 
And Now That Ive Written That Its linked Forever

Ive Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]Today Because I

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun? 
Neither Does Breathing 
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

[[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|My Friend]] Threatened To Wear A "Lil Black Skirt" And If They Do I'll Strangle Them /Affectionate

And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours 
Happiness Is A Lie 
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering 
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] On This Train

I Think Most [[Branches/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept 
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For 
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again" 
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy 
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason 
I Have Mcdonalds; Why Would I Want Mcdonalds To Taste Good

It Has Come To My Attention (Via [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] What I Think Is Best For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]) That Since I Am Undergoing Zoochosis And That The Enrichment Time That I Usually Try To Provide Myself With Is A Failing Method, The Best Thing For [[Branches/Me\|Me]] To Do For My Mental Health Is To Empty The Beehive More Frequently; The Problem Isnt My Mind, It's Keeping My Mind Locked Iniside Of Itself

Hes Literally Just Talking About Himself 
Hes Talking About Plants Now (Which Is His Job)

The More He Speaks The Less I Value His Words
And So I Keep Reading [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/House Of Leaves/HOL Mega Note\|HOL]] (For Which I have Untranscribed Notes)

That Was A Waste Of Time; I'll Try To Update This As Much As Possible Though

Hhhhh
Had To Get The 5 Train Back Dx

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

Lex Is Great 
Shout Out Lex

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

Girls Talking About How Much They Suck At The Tests Here Or [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] (I Dont Know); I <b>Do</b> Know That One Of Them Has To Redo Maths

Adam Wants To Make Fun Of That One Girl
Because Reasons 

This Lecturer, Despite Not habing Started Yet, Doesn't strike [[Branches/Me\|Me]] As A Mn who Knows What hes Doing

I Was Right, Hes Apent The First Eighteen Minutes Riffing About Ice Cream

The Most Annoying [[Branches/People\|People]] Ever Are Sitting To My Right; Im Not Sure How They Got Here; Id Ve Surprised If They Can Spell Their Own Names 

I Shouldn't Be Here
The Lectures Slow, The [[Branches/People\|People]] Are Gross, The Contents Important But The Powerpoints Are Shared Anyway; My Presence Is Just Leading To Suffering <sup>(Title Of My Autobiography)</sup>

"Its Like My Grandpa Used To Say: Hiddem With Da Fish And He'll Never See It Comin"
~ [[Branches/Me\|Me]]

"Ugh, I Need To Bend Down Like A Peasant"
~Core


This Lecturer- Emma [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]]- Has A Power Complex (Though To Be Fair Most Educators Do) But Whats Happening Is That Whenever She Notices That Someone Is Talking She Stops So That Dhe Can Stare At Them
And It Isnt So that She Can Be Heard Properly Because There Is This Really Loud Drilling Noise Which Occasionally Comes From Behind Her And Shes Just Ignored It Every Time; I Can Only Conclude The Issue Id That The Idea Of Other [[Branches/People\|People]] Not Sacrificing The Entirety Of Their Attention Id Being Treated As A Criminal Act

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--
Also Im Thinking Of Seperating This Into Multiple Pages If It Gets Too Long; Thats A Long Way Down the Road Though So Dont Worry (Xei Said To The Zero [[Branches/People\|People]] Reading)
Im Also Going To Put Up My Lecture Notes When I Start Making Them So Theres That To Look Forward To


On The Same Note (Knowing I'll Move The Previous Entry) I Started Playing Persona Three Reload Yesterday And Its A Great Game Which I Probably Would Have Had [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] To Say About But That Was Last Night And Im Forgetful 

Listened To The Magnus Protocol And We Are So Back!

Bought A 39p Chocolate Flapjack Which Is Great.

App Keeps Closing. Sucks.

Its Cool That Ive Not Had To Stay For The Hour Gap Ever

There Needs To Be A Word For Devour But For Eyes. Like You Can Devour A Chicken But You Cant Devour A Good Show
Also Taste And Smell (In A Metaphorical Sense)--
No You Can "See" Things Like Psychics And Stuff So Nevermind 

Just Missed An Empty Train :D

Train Fumes Giving [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Headache
Also Got Here In Like An Hour Which Is A Surprisingly Slow Run But Its Whatever Because I Still Have An Hour Before My Lecture 

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Branches/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Be 

As I'm Making Coffee To Mentally Fortify Myself For My Lectures I Get An Email Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] All Lectures Today Are Cancelled (51•2024•4500 Btw)
Well More Specifically I Got Email Notified Of A Canvas Message Telling [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Since IT (Incmuding Canvas) Is Malfunctioning Lectures Are Called Off

Also My Brother Gets Recommended Trans Greentext On YouTube 
L

Aaaaaaaaa

I keep forgetting I Have This

If I cant Sleep Im actually Gonna Be Really Mad :)

Really Enjoying This Season For Some Reason

4k Zen Comp Play; 2nd Supp Comp Play In Half As Many Hours 
Going To Bed

52•2024•0359 Is [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Going To Bed Early So That Im Fully Rested For Dee <s>Tomorrow</s> Today 
Also Listening To [[Branches/TMA\|TMA]] 99 Dust To Dust; Its A Gertrude Episode (Not Her Best Though)

Also, [[Branches/Me\|Me]], Its Boise City Oklahoma
You Always Forget That Settlement--
What The Gell Is My Tinnitus Doing Today Its Bloody Distracting 

Holy Hell! Today Was So Awesome!! 52•2024• 
I Got To Hang Out With Dee Like All Day-- 

I Just love Dee So Much

Also [[Explicitly Showcased/People/Special Ones/Roo/Roodolf\|Roo]] Is Cool, Glad Theyre Safe And All That

Its Been A Year But I Think Ive Finally Found My Chill Room
Theres A Random Staircase That Lasts Ten Steps And Goes Nowhere
Quiet, Air Conditioning, Dont Feel Like Im Being Stared At
None Of These Buildings Make Any Sense Whatsoever
Only Reason I Found It Was Because I Walked A Friend To His Lecture And I Saw A Door That As Far As I Could Tell Went Nowhere
I Was Wrong It Led To A Staircase And A Lift Behind More Doors And If You Walk Around The Lift? More Doors Leading To That Room

But Also You Could Add Wrighth To Glasses Or Something To Make The Invisible Wrighth Vidible

Response Douglas, I said douglas douglas. Not Dublin sonic, do a waste word. Does the game called see if mutation that came out today, it doesn't look Bad. I don't know if it looks good. I'll add it to a wish list so I don't need this track of it. I need to follow a bunch of games on here. Good Morning.

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Just Scrolled Up
Last Update Was About 192, Its 208 Now
Between Then I Have Talked At My Phone And Made A To-Do List I Have Not Revisited Once

This Is The Longest Of Those

I Really Need To Get Back On This
Also The Loom Bands I Put On My Thing- Pet, Are Breaking
Played Overwatch With Cow; It Was Fun Got A Couple Potgs And She Enjoyed Themself So All Is Good

Also Got A Lineart Update From Lilith
I Liked It But She Said She Had Some Complaints Which Is Fair Because I Dont Kbnow How To Art

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

So she was turned away
To hide her face, her lips, her guilt among the trees,
Even their leaves, to haunt caves of the forest,
To feed her love on melancholy sorow
Which, sleepless, turned her body to a shade, 
First pale and wrinkled, then a sheet of air,
Then bones which some say turned to thin-worn rocks; 
And last her voice remained.
Vanished in forest,
Far from her usual walks on hills and valleys,
She's heard by all who call; her voice has life.
The Metamorphoses by
Ovid. p. 97.


Thats All I Remember From That One
I Will Be Moving This Once I Know My Cows Seen It 


I Really Need To Sit Down And Update this

She Woke Me Up Then Said "So Youre Just Not Coming To Church Then?"
So I Got Up And She Shouted At Me On My Way Down The Stairs (To Be Fair To Her: She Shouted QtMe Because She Thought I Was My Brother So Thats Totally Fine Right?) 
Then I Said "The Hostility Isnt Necessary" And She Exclaimed "Just Go Back To Sleep!"
I May Not Understand Social Cues But I Know What "We Hate You Please Die" Means So I Went Back To Bed

same day she buys food from a chip shop (Because she hasnt cooked in a week or two) And She Goes Into The Kitchen
My Brother Comes To Get Me From My Room And When We Get Back Shes Setting Out The Food, My Brothers' In A Plate, Bread Being Buttered To Go Along With It
The Two Of Them Have A Chat And In The Middle Of This Chat My Food (Still In The Bag Gets Thrusted Towards Me")
So I Just Watched Her Be Nice To My Brother While Waiting For Her To Move So I Can Get A Fork
Im Not  Saying Dont Have Favourites, I Am Saying Dont Neglect Your Child (I Still Got Food So I Know We'll Both Count It As A Win)

She Thinks Shes Some Kind of Saint Or Something 
She Put Some Random Food In The Oven Last Night For The First Time In Two Weeks And Then Said Absolutely Nothing To Me Until Today 
"What Did She Say Hazel?"
Okay So For A Week Or Two Ive Been Trying To Go To This One Shop I Like Because Ive Wanted To Get Some Monster In My Reserves And I Havent Had The Chance
Yesterday (334•23) I Was Going To Leave But She Persevered In Stopping Me, Willing To Go As Far As To Reveal <b>Shes Hiding Her Own Food And Drinks In Her Fucking Office!!</b> Just Letting Me Die Of Dehydration For The Fun Of It
Anyway I Finally Had Breathing Room At About 17 And The Shop (Which Is A While Away) Shuts At Half Five So I Couldn't Go Despite That Be The Only Thing On My Entire To-Do List For The Weekend
All This To Say That Today (After It Stopped Raining Bullets) I Left To Go To This Mystical Shop And The Second I Close The Door I Het The Message "Whose gone out?"
Im Not Taking That Bait So My Brother Told Her I Left And She Said "Is the kitchen clean then?"
A) Thats Not A Prerequisite Condition, Nor Was It Ever Discussed
2) If It Weren't Me That Left (Or Had You Been Hallucinating) Could The Kitchen Have Instead Been Put Into Further Dissaray?
III) What The Fuck Does Any Of This Have To Do With Your Avatar-Of-The-Web, Up-In- 
My-Business, Controlling Ass? Fuck Off And Let Me Breathe
I Just Sent Back A WhatsApp Sticker Of Someone Killing Themself And Let Her Respond With Her Rant About How Shes Been So Nice To Me By Only Cooking Herself Food For Two Weeks And Following It Up With How The Problem Is That I Don't Clean After Myself (I Haven't Eaten In Two Weeks, All The Dirty Dishes Are Of Her Design)
Moving Onwards A Bit To Relatively Current Events Where In She Steps Into The Kitchen, Stops Moving And Stares At Me For Twenty(Ish) Seconds - I Should Start Timing Those - Before Simultaiously Asking Me When Im Going To Clean Her Mess And Demanding I Do It Right Now
I Didnt Take The Bait
Wrong Answer
After Some Verbal Abuse About Me Being Useless She Says "I Asked You A Question And I Want The Kitchen Cleaned Today", Doubling Down On Pretending I Have Free Will
I Told Her Tomorrow 
Wrong Answer Again But I Think Ive Avoided Most Of Her Wrath Until Tomorrow 
I Will Be Staying Out As Late As I Can So I Dont Have To Deal With Her Shit For Longer Than Necessary, When I Get Back I Will Clean Any Of My Plates Which Are Less Than Satisfactory And Then I Shall Be Going To Bed, Because I Know She Will Not Be Providing Me With Any Necessities

Not Being Able To Feel Hatred For Anyone Is Possibly The Only Thing Keeping Me Sane In This House As It Would be Easier To Hate Her And Break Shit

I Came Downstairs To clean TheK8tcgen But Shes Already Done It
So Im Gonna Cook For My Brother 


Im Here Trying To Mind My Own Business And She Comes Down Stairs And Immediately Starts A Fight
Shouting, Complaining Talking About How Hard Cleaning Is For Her (Not For Any reason, Shes Just a Narcissist)

Shes Still Shouting
Apparently My Bag Being Next To Me Is A Huuuuge Mess
And The Kitchen I Haven't Cleaned Yet (Or Abandoned) Is The Worst Crime Imaginable 

Shes Gonna Suffer
And Im Gonna Laugh
All She Does Is Care About Herself And Try To Make My Life A Misery
So All I'll Do Is Return The Favour

Im Going To Keep Going
And I Know She Will Too

Maybe Ill Start Including Every Interaction We Have
I Mean Other Than I Was In Her Room On Saturday I Think Youre All Caught Up For The Month
‍
For Anyone Who Wants To See The Huge, Unforgivable Mess I Made In The Kitchen
![[20231212_000310.jpg\|20231212_000310.jpg]]
<sub>That Has Food In It By The Way
I Didnt Trust My Mother To Not Let Us Starve So I Made Enough To Eat TomorrowAs Well</sub>

She Has Learned About The Concept Of Food
Unlocked: One Orange Juice

Why The Fuck is She Singing
I Cant Be Here
I Can Hear Her In My Room
Kill Me

Shes Hiding The Kitchenware
There Are Missing Forks And No Crockery 

Ive Been Listening To Her Shouting On The Phone For Hours
Its Stressful
Ive Been Meaning To Leave My Room For Ages But I Dont Want To Deal With....That

I Have Food Now
Her Torturous Voice Echos Throughout The House And Comes At You From Every Conceivable Place 

Theres A Scene At The End Of A Lot Of Hamtaro Episodes Where The Mother (I Dont Remember Anyones Names) Says [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] About Or Directed Towards The Daughter But Says The Wrong Name  
Theres One Scene In Particular Thats Stuck With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Where The Mother Addresses The Girl As "Brandy" To Which She Replies "Thats The Dog Mom...."  
The Reason Its Always Stuck With [[Branches/Me\|Me]] Is Because Thats How I Feel Every Time I Have A Conversation With My Mother  
I Know Shes Not Listening And That I Have - And Will Have To - Repeat Whatever I Just Said To Someone Who Ultimately Doesnt Care One Way Or The Other


Was Talking To My Mother About Getting Skates And She Started Talking About How Theyre Hard And I Shouldn't Waste My Money And Blah Blah Blah So Ive Decided: Fuck You
So Thats Like Two Hundred Quid Gone And I Dont Even Care If I Use Them

My Rooms Cold And My Mothers All "You Probably Broke [The Radiator] I Wouldn't Be Surprised"
Excuse Me‽ Bitch

I Try Do Hard To Not Add To Thid Page; That Woman Shovels So Much Negative Energy Into My Soul
Energy That I Dont Want To Use To Fuel My Being; Or Even To Fuel My Writing In Any Form....Yet Here We Are

My Mothers Trying To Tell [[Branches/Me\|Me]] That Imposter Syndrome Is When Someone Pretends To Be You 

My Mother Wanted To Watch A Movie Then My Brother Started A Conversation 
When It Ended I Asked Her To Rewind And When She Did She Called My Brother Back :/
