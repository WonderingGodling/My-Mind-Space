# <span style="color:#F00000">My Mother: A Failure In Three Acts Part Who Gives A Fuck (I Know She Doesnt)</span>

Finally Snapped And Decided To Make This Shit Public Because Im Actually Fully And Completely Done With Her
I Dont Know Why She Thinks She Deserves Any Respect From Anybody
Case And Point: i Just Tried To Explain To Her Why She Should Listen To My Brother Instead Of Just Yelling At Him (For Stuff He Didnt Do (I Only Got To The Lsiten Part, The Rest Was Too Complicated)) And Instead Of Listen To A Word I Said She Threw A Literal Tantrum
She Jumped Up And Down, Screaming What Started As "I Dont Want To Talk" (Those Of You With Two Brain Cells Will Remember The Only Word Id Said So Far Was "Listen") But Devolved Into Unintelligible Screeching Which Ive Never Heard From Someone Over The Age Of Eight.

Dont Worry Theres So Much More For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] To Say About The Asshole So This'll Be Updated
Also Her Names At The Top Because I Want Everyone To Know This Isnt Some Hypothetical Mother, This Is A Mentally Abusive Piece Of Shit That I Live With Every Day

For The Record (My Record) This Was Created On 334,23 Which Was Supposed To Be A Good Day For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

Ive Spoken To Her Twice This Week (48,23)
The First Time I Didnt Appreciate The Way She Villainized [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And The Second Time Was Just 
And You Know What? I Bet She Didnt Even Fucking Notice!
Shes Never Given A Fuck About [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And Everyone Knows It

(This Next Bit Is Imported)
She Said She Doesnt Care
Then Changed Her Mind
Then Was A Prick About Us Not Having Ordered Allready
So Fuck Her She Can Have The Chicken Balti
If We Dont Pick Up When She Calls Us Its A Crime
But When She Doesnt Pick Up We Shouldnt Be Looking Out For Her In The First Place

## Mother

Theres A Scene At The End Of A Lot Of Hamtaro Episodes Where The Mother (I Dont Remember Anyones Names) Says [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] About Or Directed Towards The Daughter But Says The Wrong Name  
Theres One Scene In Particular Thats Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Where The Mother Addresses The Girl As "Brandy" To Which She Replies "Thats The Dog Mom...."  
The Reason Its Always Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Is Because Thats How I Feel Every Time I Have A Conversation With My Mother  
I Know Shes Not Listening And That I Have - And Will Have To - Repeat Whatever I Just Said To Someone Who Ultimately Doesnt Care One Way Or The Other

Fuck I Dont Update This Enough  
More Imports:


</div></div>


She Woke Me Up Then Said "So Youre Just Not Coming To Church Then?"
So I Got Up And She Shouted At Me On My Way Down The Stairs (To Be Fair To Her: She Shouted QtMe Because She Thought I Was My Brother So Thats Totally Fine Right?) 
Then I Said "The Hostility Isnt Necessary" And She Exclaimed "Just Go Back To Sleep!"
I May Not Understand Social Cues But I Know What "We Hate You Please Die" Means So I Went Back To Bed

same day she buys food from a chip shop (Because she hasnt cooked in a week or two) And She Goes Into The Kitchen
My Brother Comes To Get Me From My Room And When We Get Back Shes Setting Out The Food, My Brothers' In A Plate, Bread Being Buttered To Go Along With It
The Two Of Them Have A Chat And In The Middle Of This Chat My Food (Still In The Bag Gets Thrusted Towards Me")
So I Just Watched Her Be Nice To My Brother While Waiting For Her To Move So I Can Get A Fork
Im Not  Saying Dont Have Favourites, I Am Saying Dont Neglect Your Child (I Still Got Food So I Know We'll Both Count It As A Win)
