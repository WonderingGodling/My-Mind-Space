# <center><span style="color:#F00000">My Mother: A Failure In Three Acts Part Who Gives A Fuck (I Know She Doesnt)</span>

Finally Snapped And Decided To Make This Shit Public Because Im Actually Fully And Completely Done With Her
I Dont Know Why She Thinks She Deserves Any Respect From Anybody
Case And Point: i Just Tried To Explain To Her Why She Should Listen To My Brother Instead Of Just Yelling At Him (For Stuff He Didnt Do (I Only Got To The Lsiten Part, The Rest Was Too Complicated)) And Instead Of Listen To A Word I Said She Threw A Literal Tantrum
She Jumped Up And Down, Screaming What Started As "I Dont Want To Talk" (Those Of You With Two Brain Cells Will Remember The Only Word Id Said So Far Was "Listen") But Devolved Into Unintelligible Screeching Which Ive Never Heard From Someone Over The Age Of Eight.

Dont Worry Theres So Much More For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] To Say About The Asshole So This'll Be Updated
Also Her Names At The Top Because I Want Everyone To Know This Isnt Some Hypothetical Mother, This Is A Mentally Abusive Piece Of Shit That I Live With Every Day

For The Record (My Record) This Was Created On 334,23 Which Was Supposed To Be A Good Day For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

Ive Spoken To Her Twice This Week (48,23)
The First Time I Didnt Appreciate The Way She Villainized [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And The Second Time Was Just 
And You Know What? I Bet She Didnt Even Fucking Notice!
Shes Never Given A Fuck About [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] And Everyone Knows It

(This Next Bit Is Imported)
She Said She Doesnt Care
Then Changed Her Mind
Then Was A Prick About Us Not Having Ordered Allready
So Fuck Her She Can Have The Chicken Balti
If We Dont Pick Up When She Calls Us Its A Crime
But When She Doesnt Pick Up We Shouldnt Be Looking Out For Her In The First Place

## Mother

Theres A Scene At The End Of A Lot Of Hamtaro Episodes Where The Mother (I Dont Remember Anyones Names) Says [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] About Or Directed Towards The Daughter But Says The Wrong Name  
Theres One Scene In Particular Thats Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Where The Mother Addresses The Girl As "Brandy" To Which She Replies "Thats The Dog Mom...."  
The Reason Its Always Stuck With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Is Because Thats How I Feel Every Time I Have A Conversation With My Mother  
I Know Shes Not Listening And That I Have - And Will Have To - Repeat Whatever I Just Said To Someone Who Ultimately Doesnt Care One Way Or The Other

Fuck I Dont Update This Enough  
More Imports:


</div></div>


She Woke Me Up Then Said "So Youre Just Not Coming To Church Then?"
So I Got Up And She Shouted At Me On My Way Down The Stairs (To Be Fair To Her: She Shouted QtMe Because She Thought I Was My Brother So Thats Totally Fine Right?) 
Then I Said "The Hostility Isnt Necessary" And She Exclaimed "Just Go Back To Sleep!"
I May Not Understand Social Cues But I Know What "We Hate You Please Die" Means So I Went Back To Bed

same day she buys food from a chip shop (Because she hasnt cooked in a week or two) And She Goes Into The Kitchen
My Brother Comes To Get Me From My Room And When We Get Back Shes Setting Out The Food, My Brothers' In A Plate, Bread Being Buttered To Go Along With It
The Two Of Them Have A Chat And In The Middle Of This Chat My Food (Still In The Bag Gets Thrusted Towards Me")
So I Just Watched Her Be Nice To My Brother While Waiting For Her To Move So I Can Get A Fork
Im Not  Saying Dont Have Favourites, I Am Saying Dont Neglect Your Child (I Still Got Food So I Know We'll Both Count It As A Win)

She Thinks Shes Some Kind of Saint Or Something 
She Put Some Random Food In The Oven Last Night For The First Time In Two Weeks And Then Said Absolutely Nothing To Me Until Today 
"What Did She Say Hazel?"
Okay So For A Week Or Two Ive Been Trying To Go To This One Shop I Like Because Ive Wanted To Get Some Monster In My Reserves And I Havent Had The Chance
Yesterday (334•23) I Was Going To Leave But She Persevered In Stopping Me, Willing To Go As Far As To Reveal <b>Shes Hiding Her Own Food And Drinks In Her Fucking Office!!</b> Just Letting Me Die Of Dehydration For The Fun Of It
Anyway I Finally Had Breathing Room At About 17 And The Shop (Which Is A While Away) Shuts At Half Five So I Couldn't Go Despite That Be The Only Thing On My Entire To-Do List For The Weekend
All This To Say That Today (After It Stopped Raining Bullets) I Left To Go To This Mystical Shop And The Second I Close The Door I Het The Message "Whose gone out?"
Im Not Taking That Bait So My Brother Told Her I Left And She Said "Is the kitchen clean then?"
A) Thats Not A Prerequisite Condition, Nor Was It Ever Discussed
2) If It Weren't Me That Left (Or Had You Been Hallucinating) Could The Kitchen Have Instead Been Put Into Further Dissaray?
III) What The Fuck Does Any Of This Have To Do With Your Avatar-Of-The-Web, Up-In- 
My-Business, Controlling Ass? Fuck Off And Let Me Breathe
I Just Sent Back A WhatsApp Sticker Of Someone Killing Themself And Let Her Respond With Her Rant About How Shes Been So Nice To Me By Only Cooking Herself Food For Two Weeks And Following It Up With How The Problem Is That I Don't Clean After Myself (I Haven't Eaten In Two Weeks, All The Dirty Dishes Are Of Her Design)
Moving Onwards A Bit To Relatively Current Events Where In She Steps Into The Kitchen, Stops Moving And Stares At Me For Twenty(Ish) Seconds - I Should Start Timing Those - Before Simultaiously Asking Me When Im Going To Clean Her Mess And Demanding I Do It Right Now
I Didnt Take The Bait
Wrong Answer
After Some Verbal Abuse About Me Being Useless She Says "I Asked You A Question And I Want The Kitchen Cleaned Today", Doubling Down On Pretending I Have Free Will
I Told Her Tomorrow 
Wrong Answer Again But I Think Ive Avoided Most Of Her Wrath Until Tomorrow 
I Will Be Staying Out As Late As I Can So I Dont Have To Deal With Her Shit For Longer Than Necessary, When I Get Back I Will Clean Any Of My Plates Which Are Less Than Satisfactory And Then I Shall Be Going To Bed, Because I Know She Will Not Be Providing Me With Any Necessities

Not Being Able To Feel Hatred For Anyone Is Possibly The Only Thing Keeping Me Sane In This House As It Would be Easier To Hate Her And Break Shit

I Came Downstairs To clean TheK8tcgen But Shes Already Done It
So Im Gonna Cook For My Brother 


Im Here Trying To Mind My Own Business And She Comes Down Stairs And Immediately Starts A Fight
Shouting, Complaining Talking About How Hard Cleaning Is For Her (Not For Any reason, Shes Just a Narcissist)

Shes Still Shouting
Apparently My Bag Being Next To Me Is A Huuuuge Mess
And The Kitchen I Haven't Cleaned Yet (Or Abandoned) Is The Worst Crime Imaginable 

Shes Gonna Suffer
And Im Gonna Laugh
All She Does Is Care About Herself And Try To Make My Life A Misery
So All I'll Do Is Return The Favour
