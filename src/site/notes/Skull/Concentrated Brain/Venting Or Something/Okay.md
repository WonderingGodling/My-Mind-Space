"Okay?"
"Am I Okay?"
No I Am Very Obviously Not Okay
I Dont Think I Ever Have Been Nor Ever Will Be Okay
Am I Happy?
Sure
Quite Often In Fact
Am I Alive?
More So Than I Would Like To Admit
But "Okay"?
You Dare Even Know Of My Existence And Consider The Idea That I Might Be Okay?
Youre Not Allowed To Enter **My** Mind Space And Insinuate A Possibility Or Correctness
So No
To Summarise
Im Not Okay And For As Long Bas That Question Remains As A Whisper In The Collective Of The Human Psyche  I Hope That Nobody Else Is Either
