You Ever Get Those Days Where Existinng Causes Burnout? 
I Feel Like Ive Done So Much Today But Ive Done Absoulutely [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] 
And I Was Kinda Looking Forward To This Party Tomorrow But Im Not Going Bbecause I Have A Comedy Show Im Going To Instead

ETA: I Did Show Up To The End, Saw Some Old Friends

### Public Transport Rant

Public Transport Is So Horrible In This Country 
I Mean It Exists Which Is More Than I Can Say For Like New York (Imagine Getting A Tram In Nyc) 
But Its Still Horrendous 
Its Expensive, Infrequent, Slow, Gross, Exploitative, Inconvenient, Inconsistant And Worst Of All: You Cant Use It Efficiently Without Research 
You Shouldnt Have To Figure Out If Its Better To Buy A Ticket There And Back Or Just One Ticket That Does Both 
(The Answer? It Depends :/)

### Sometimes Im Just Like Whyyyyyy

At The Moment My Hands Smell Like Artificial Vanilla Which Is Not Helping With The Derealisation 
A Slight Feeling That My Entire Perception Of The World Is Fabricated Accompanied By My Hands Smelling Like A Playdoh Cookie Before [[Branches/People\|People]] Were Worried About Kids Killing Themselves 
Its Not Even A Good Vanilla Smell So Smelling It Provides An Indescribable Feeling

## This Is Imported

I Dont Get This Library 
I Think Its Designed So That You Cant Find Anything 
So You Have To Be A Student To Read 
The Chemistry Is By Textiles 
The Psychology Is Above Renewable Energy 
And It Seems To Be Alphabetical Within The Subject? 
I Got To My Class And There Already [[Branches/People\|People]] There (ETA: Not My [[Branches/People\|People]] Other [[Branches/People\|People]])

First Time Ive Touched My Phone For An Hour Or Two 
Im Becoming More Familiar With The Back Of My Eyelids Than The Contents Of My Imagination 
To Sleep Per Chance To Dream But To Be Forced To Struggle Through A Waking Nightmare Is Just To Suffer Eternity In Your Own Mind

### Public Transport Rant (Train Edition)

The One Thing I Hate About Trains Is Im NeveR Sure Im On The Right One Until The Announcer Speaks 
Like Im Sitting Here And The Train Goes "Beep Boop Train To Shrewsbury" And Im Like Cool 
Im Not Going To Shrewsbury But Wolverhampton Is A Stop On That Train 
I Know All This Its All Goo 
The Problem Is That That Doesn't Play Until The Doors Are Closed 
So If It Said The Wrong Train Id Just Have To Be Like • _ • 
Then Now That Its Moving It Like "Where Also Stopping At All These Places" And Im Like I Know 
Thats The Train I Got On

So Many [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Random Thoughts/Constant Comment (Not The Tea)\|Thoughts]], None Of Which Carry With Them The Drive For Dictation 
Im Just Thinking And Existing And Dealing With It Because I Just Dont Feel Like Writing It

I Haven't Updated This In A While But Thats Because Im Secretly **Losing My Mind!**

Today- This Week (42·2023) Has Been Stressful 
Its Tuesday 
Ive Spent The Whole Time Feeling Like A Zombie Then Being Dragged Out Of My Cosy Void 
Also Had So Much I Wanted To Write But Just Never Did

Watching Fun Dougdoug Video Where He Fails At Mario For Six Hours 
That Doesn't Sound Fun? 
Neither Does Breathing 
So On The Scale Of Enjoyment Im Leaning Towards Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Something\|Something]] I Guess

Right Now I Regret Everything I Feel 
And I Feel [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]]

Very Few Things Bring [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Happiness 
And One Of Those Things Has Been Leaving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] On Read For Hours 
Happiness Is A Lie 
Life Is A Chain Of Suffering 
Thank You For Coming To My Ted Talk

Zoned Out So Hard Buy Only For An Hour So We're Good I Think

Im Currently Doing [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] On This Train 
My Book And Headphones Are In My Bag And Getting Either Will Take Way More Energy Than I Have

**"Whats The Point Of Trying To Stay Alive All This Time....If Im Going To Die By My Own Hand"**

I Think Most [[Branches/People\|People]] With Low Self-Esteem Or Shitty Parents Feel A Deep Desire To Be Loved But I Feel Like It Just Made [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Hate The Concept 
Maybe Thats What Dads From The Seventies Were Aiming For 
"If I Hate My Son He'll Become Emotionally Unavailable Then I'll Never Have To Deal With It Again" 
Well Ive Got Good News And Bad News For Ya 
The Good News Is: I Want To Kill Myself More Than I Want To Be Happy 
The Bad News Is I Dont Hate Gay [[Branches/People\|People]] So....Sorry Dad

I Just Took A Pepper Grinder From The Kitchen From My Room For No Reason 
I Have Mcdonalds; Why Would I Want Mcdonalds To Taste Good 
I Dont Know What My Subconscious Is Up To 

Mmmm 
Markiplier Isnt Cheering [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Up And I Dont Feel Like Music Right Now

I Wanted Tea
I Cant Go Downstairs Though Because My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Wendy\|Mother]]'s Lurking Around

I Dont Wanna Hear Christmas Music
I Cannot Stand Christmas Music
Most Christmas Songs Are Ear Grating But They Get A Pass Because Theyre About Christmas 
Thats Not How Songs Work!
Write A Good Song **Then** I'll Hope It Comes On The Radio
Nobodys Walking Over To A Jukebox And Playing Do They Know Its Christmas 
You Know What They Are Playing?
Africa
Essentially About The Same Thing Except Ones Shit And Mentions Christmas In The Chorus

This CD Im Looking At Has 1000 Miles On It
Thats Not A Christmas Song?
Ave Maria‽
Does Jesus Song Just Mean Christmas Song?
OVER THE RAINBOW
Why Do We Bother

Im Trying To Cook But My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Is A Few Actions Before My Brain So I Haven't Technically Started 

I Think The Worst Part About Being Raped To Death Is That while Your Name, Face And Family Are All Across The News There Will Be countless Police Officers, Investigators/Detectives, Forensics, Mortuars and So Many Other People Poking Around You Insides Like; Really? This Is So Not The Time For That! I Think Id Least Want [[Branches/People\|People]] Touching My Dead [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] If The Cause Of My Death Was Someone Touching My Live [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]]

I Always Feel Like I Shouldnt Be In This [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] But Recently Ive Felt That My [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Doesn't Belong With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] In It

I Envy Suicide Bombers And Kamikaze Pilots
Getting To Kill Yourself And Truely Believe The World Is Better Sounds Like The Dream

Its Been Over A Week Since Ive Said Anything And That New Installment Is Lamenting About Not Killing Myself 

Being Perceived Isnt For Everybody 
I Know Its Not For [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

•9314
I Just Realised I've Felt Quite "...." This Evening Which Is Very Impressive When You Consider That On Any Given Day: I Cant Feel
What That Means Is ~~I've Simply Been Rotting..............Complacent~~! Ive Simply Been Rotting Complacently Without Realising That Either The Rotting Or The Complacency Was An Option

•1440 Lets See How Late I Sleep In

I Really Need to Type Stuff Up More Because Keeping It In Is Driving [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Towards Madness And The [[Branches/People\|People]] Who At Least Pretend To Care All Have Actual Things That Go On On Their Actual Lives--

Whatd The Opposite Of Cooking Because Thats What Im Doing--
Rotting Works Surprisingly Well For That Actually; Prolonged Uncookery And Suffering 
Maybe If I Was The Hunt Id Feel Better; I Can Definitely See How A Light Hunter Would Be Able To Thrive (Although Why A Light Watcher Isnt Frankly Escapes [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]])

Every Time I See A Picture Of Myself The Best I Can Do To Describe My Attitude Towards It Is Stranger; I Feel Like When Im In An Image Or A Video The Thing That Is [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Is Wrong
I Know Thats Some Form Of [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Venting Or Something/Body\|Body]] Dysmorphia Or Whatever And I Also Know That I Dont Really Care Enough About It To Do Anything
I Guess Its Just That I Would Find Most Of My Life To Be Easier If I Weren'tAble To Be Perceived
Really Wish The SEP Existed So [[Branches/People\|People]] Would Just Let [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Be 

Watching Myself On The Edge Of Disassociation (Im Not Spelling That Right); Watching Myself Not Pay Attention

I Dont Want To Exist Right Now

Ive Been Up For Like Two Hours, Done [[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] And Burned 34% Of My Battery And Honestly If I Could Just Coast In This State I Would 

I Haven't Really Eaten Or Drank Anything All Day And My Mother's Been Camping The Kitchen For Hours

Vie's Too Busy Cleaning To Deal With [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]] Dx

Why The Hell Are Family So Damn Loud
It Doesn't Help That My Aunt Can Drown Out The Cries Of A Tortured Hyena, Nor That Everyones Response To The Calamity That Spills From Her Lips Is To Shout Over It

How Long Do You Think Itll Be Until I Hit The "[[Skull/Concentrated Brain/Poetry Apparently/Thing Trilogy/Nothing\|Nothing]] Ever Changes" Wall Of Uni? Or Until I Have Another Genuine Meltdown? 
Im Taking Bets; Closest Without Going Over <33

Ive Had No Purposeful [[Constant Comment (Not The Tea) \|Thoughts]] For Like Three Days; I Feel Like Death, Especially In The Sense That I Have No Way To Think About My Current State


I Keep Forgetting, Amid My Own Depressive Episodes, To Keep Updates On My Current Antics And I Would Love For Someone To Remind [[Explicitly Showcased/Me/Me\|Me]]

Bought New Earphones And Now I Wanna Die
I Can Feel My Bank Account Bleeding

#

Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Im Gonna Play Overwatch And Stop Remembering I Exist
Itll Be Fun [Xe Lied To Themself; Not Wanting To Play Overwatch]

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Gonna Blow My Brains Out I Hate This I Hate This I Hate This I Hate This I Hatie This I Hate This I Hate This I Haite This
<b>SIGH</b>

I Haven't Talked To Vie In Over A Week And Its Actually Killing Me And I Cant Talk To Anyone About It Because Best Case Scenario Literally Gets Me Nowhere And Worse Case Scenario Probably Gets Me Starved To Death
I Haven't Been Able To Write Anything Because All Im Thinking All Day Is "Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I Just Want To Stop Existing Or At The Very Least Stop Functioning But My Worthless Body cant Even Figure Out How To Cry Which Is Step Two Of Being Depressed, Overwhelming Self Hatred And Hoping For Your Own Doom Is Usually Much Later For Normal People (Not That If Be Faliliar With That)
This Week Ive Tried Going On Walks And Skating And Watching Movies  And Tv Shows And Social Media And Pornography And Books And Podcast And Hanging Out With Friends And Doing Nothing Each For Literal Hours At A Time Hoping That Maybe If Im Absorbed Enough In It The Dull Sense That My Interacting With The World I Slowly Making It Worse Will Fade Into The Background But Theres No such Thing As Relief I Guess

Im Weirdly Out Of Fucks
I Have A Bunch Of Stuff I Want To Do But Theres None Of It That I Want To Do

Its 1361·253·24 And I Did Wholeheartedly Plan On Updating This Earlier But Not Like This
It Was Gonna Be A Quick Update On What I Did Over The Past Few Weeks, The Places Ive Gone, The People Ive Talked To, But Overall I Just Feel Like Shit Barely Scraping By Every Day, Not Taking Care Of Myself, Not Even Enjoying Myself Really But Thats Whatever

I Hope If I Update This Again Its More Of The Norm And Less Of The Depression And Everybody-Hates-Meness That Has Been Thrust Upon Me

Like Even My Wife, Who Is The Best And Can Do No Wrong, Will Be  Online And Not Read My Messages Sometimes
An Obvious Dagger To The Heart But At The Same Time I Will Usually Hear From Her After A Bit, Or Get A Liked Message Notification And The Dagger Will Be Removed
Some Other People Though Open My Messages To Figure Out How To Better Arrange Daggers Into My Chest Cavity

The Entire Last Paragraph And A Bit Werent Meamnt To Exist, I Guess Im Just That Passionate About How Much I Want To Be Wiped Off The Face Of The Earth Sometiemes

Also Whoevers Reading This: im Sure I Think Youre A Delight, If Youre Part Of The Problem Just....Idk Be More Conciderate Of My Emoptions I Guess? I Know Im Not But Someone Should Be

Why Would I Use This For Something That Makses Sense Like Writing Down All My Thoughts And Important Notes And Stuff Or Even To Say I Appreciate It When This Is Read (Even Though I Only Think One Person Ever Reads This) But Instead Im Gonna Do This:

Im Actually Just Ruining My Mind- What? Losing My Mind
Sitting On The Train, One Ear Plugged In And The Other Being Accosted By Sound
Got The Gay Umbrella Though 

If I Go Through Vies Messages Id Have To Fill This Website With So Much Stuff Then Id Just Be Thinking About That Instead Of Enjoing My Distractions So Im Gonna Not Do That

AlsO My Headphones Didnt Arive >:(((((
	
Actually Would Be Rreally Funny If The Person Who Was Helping Me Cope With Abandonment Left Me Because I Was Strugling With Abandonment.....

I Was Gonna Write Something Earlier....Anywhatevers

I Am Shaking <b>Bad</b>


My Brain Is Having Not Great Ideas As Coping Mechanisms
If They Could Take Out Their Agression On Me Id Feel As If I Got What I Deserved And Everyones Lives Would Be Better
I Know Thats Not The Case But I Feel Like What Im Experiencing Every Day Probably Hurts More Or Maybe Im Just Hoping For A New Source Of Discomfort So That The Repetition Isnt What Drives Me Insane

I Feel Like I Shouldnt Say Any Of This And That Any Response I Get Wouldn't Be Genuine 
Like If I Suck As Much As I Think I Do Nobody Would Want To Have That Conversation And Im Sorry To Whoever Thats Inconvenienced (It Will Happen Again)
