I think it's pretty safe to assume. There's no lab sophisticated enough yet to synthesise the kind of chemicals I need.

I'd been involved thrills of looking for an apartment after a little difficulty with a landlord who woke up one morning convinced he was Charles De Gaulle. I was so stunned by this announcement that before I could think twice I'd already told him how in my humble estimation. He did not at all resemble an airport, though the thought of A 757 landing on him was not at all disagreeable.  I was promptly evicted.
He just like me for real.

The word house here is kind of subscript. However, in the full colour or The 2 colour version house appears in blue.

The landlord burnt the place to the ground a week later. That is so desolation coded.
He told the police a 757 had crashed into it.
