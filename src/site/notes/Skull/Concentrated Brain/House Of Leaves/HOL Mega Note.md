I think it's pretty safe to assume. There's no lab sophisticated enough yet to synthesise the kind of chemicals I need.


I'd been involved thrills of looking for an apartment after a little difficulty with a landlord who woke up one morning convinced he was Charles De Gaulle. I was so stunned by this announcement that before I could think twice I'd already told him how in my humble estimation. He did not at all resemble an airport, though the thought of A 757 landing on him was not at all disagreeable.  I was promptly evicted.
He just like me for real.


The word house here is kind of subscript. However, in the full colour or The 2 colour version house appears in blue.


The landlord burnt the place to the ground a week later. That is so desolation coded.
He told the police a 757 had crashed into it.

"at The Time I Just Figured Lude Had Been Putting Me On. He Likes To Exaggerate."


Perspective Apprentices At A Tattoo Shop


It was the end of '96. Nights were cold. I was
getting over this woman named Clara English who had
told me she wanted to date someone at the top of the
food chain. So I demonstrated my unflagging devotion
to her memory by immediately developing a heavy crush
on this stripper who had Thumper tattooed right
beneath her G-string, barely an inch from her shaved
pussy or as she liked to call it "The Happiest place
On Earth." Suffice it say, Lude & I spent the last
hours of the year alone, scouting for new bars, new
faces, driving recklessly through the canyons, doing
our best to talk the high midnight heavens down with
whole lot of bullshit. We never did. Talk them down
I mean
Then the old man died.



From what I can gather now, he was an American.
Though as I would later find out , those who worked
with him detected an accent even if they could never
say for certain where it came from

I never came across any sort of ID, whether a passport, license or other official
locument insinuating that yes, he indeed was An-
ctual-&-Accounted-For person.


though he mostly kept to
himself, he never failed to appear every morning and
evening to walk around the courtyard, a wild place
with knee high weeds and back then populated with over
eighty stray cats. Apparently the cats liked the old
man alot and though he offered no enticements, they
would constantly rub up against his legs before
darting back into the center of that dusty place.


"we knew what we'd find," he said. "We <u>knew</u> that guy was dead."

Still, this was better
than the prostitute the paramedics had seen earlier
that day. She had been torn to pieces in a hotel
room, parts of her used to paint the walls and ceiling
red.

Prostitues <b>CALLED</b> Thumper??

"The first peculiar thing," Lude told me,
leading the way around a short flight of stairs.
"Were the cats." Apparently in the months preceding
the old man's death, the cats had begun to disappear
By the time he died they were all gone.
"I saw one
with its head ripped off and another with its guts
strewn all over the sidewalk. Mostly though, they
just vanished."

Now I
shudder. Back then, I think I was elsewhere. More
than likely daydreaming about Thumper. This will
probably really wig you out, I don't care, but one
night I even rented Bambi and got a hard on. That's
how bad I had it for her. Thumper was something else
and she sure beat the hell out of Clara English.
Perhaps at that moment I was even thinking about what
the two would look like in a cat fight.
