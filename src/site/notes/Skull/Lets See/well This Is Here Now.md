  <strong><span class="black">====&gt; Dave: Bring up uncomfortable topics with John</span></strong>
</p><p>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: john we should really talk about this thing with you and roxy<br>
DAVE: starting to get out of hand<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: what?  i thought you’ve always been fine with us dating!<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: no thats cool<br>
DAVE: pretty much had to get over thoughts of you constantly plowing my sorta mom a while back<br>
DAVE: but the fact that im hearing that said plowing recently involves an ever changing third party<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: oh god.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: yeah that shits a little fucking different<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: can we please not talk about the threesome thing?<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: no i think we kinda should<br>
DAVE: like i dont know if you made it your mission to screw every remaining girl that we know or whatever<br>
DAVE: and if that is the case then hey i guess its cool youre making progress there<br>
DAVE: give you a solid bro fist bump and all like congrats on the sex<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: ok, first off, that’s not what’s going on!<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: then what is going on<br>
DAVE: are you like tripping into vaginas or something<br>
DAVE: like walking down the hall whoops i stumbled and accidentally wound up inside you rose sorry about that<br>
DAVE: jade showed you a shitty anime like that and you said fuck yes new life goals<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: no!<br>
JOHN: and it’s not like i’m trying to do this or anything!  i don’t get up planning to have a threesome every day!<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: yeah im sure it must be really fucking hard on you<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: well…ok, yeah, i’ll admit it hasn’t exactly been a bad experience<br>
JOHN: but it’s not something i’m planning to do!  they just sorta…<br>
JOHN: um…<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: no do go on<br>
DAVE: let me know how these threesomes just fucking happen to you out of thin air<br>
DAVE: youre just going about your day like normal until suddenly roxy 
and some other girl wind up in your bed unannounced so guess we might as
 well fuck<br>
DAVE: thats how its going then<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: uh…<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: wait what<br>
DAVE: what uh<br>
DAVE: why is there an uh there<br>
DAVE: that cant seriously be whats happening<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: it…pretty much is though.<br>
JOHN: roxy’s the one who does most of the convincing!<br>
JOHN: and then they come to me, and explain it, and…<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: no were stopping right fucking there<br>
DAVE: what is this convincing horseshit about<br>
DAVE: you cant possibly be telling me that your girlfriend who is also 
my hot mom is just guiding women to your bed for you to bang with her<br>
DAVE: i really just need you to tell me that my hot ectomom is not essentially a threesome genie and youve got unlimited wishes<br>
DAVE: please tell me thats not whats happening here john<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: no, that’s…probably a good description, dave.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: great<br>
DAVE: thats fucking great<br>
DAVE: well i guess theres no getting that out of my head<br>
DAVE: so since were here already we might as well go all the way down this nightmare hole<br>
DAVE: how the fuck did this happen john<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: uh…probably because of terezi?<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: why am i not fucking surprised<br>
DAVE: of course your cackling buzzsaw demon of a hatefriend is behind this somehow<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: she’s not really “behind it”, exactly.<br>
JOHN: but she was the one who asked us if we wanted to try a threesome.<br>
JOHN: i think her reasoning was that it wasn’t terribly unusual to do 
something like that when sharing one partner in different quadrants.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: told you that quadrants shit was trouble going in<br>
DAVE: although I guess trouble in your case turned into a cavalcade of vaginas so what do I know<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: right, so we do it, and…well, it was really fucking good, i’m not gonna lie.<br>
JOHN: roxy really enjoyed it too…probably too much, though.<br>
JOHN: she kept inviting terezi over for threesomes more often, and 
eventually we were doing it with her more often than we were with just 
the two of us.<br>
JOHN: like she was getting addicted to it, sorta.<br>
JOHN: then she had the idea to bring other partners in and started “convincing” them to try it.<br>
JOHN: either just saying that it would be fun, or making out with them 
just before I get there so they’re already in the mood, or…something 
like that.<br>
JOHN: and then i show up and…roxy convinces me to join in, and…<br>
JOHN: yeah.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: which brings us to now<br>
DAVE: and you fucking pretty much every girl we know<br>
DAVE: seriously how the fuck does she do that<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: i dunno!  she’s just really convincing!<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: im sure<br>
DAVE: after all she somehow convinced you to fuck all of them<br>
DAVE: dunno how she manages to do that must take fucking miracles<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: uhhh….</span>
</p><p>
  <strong><span class="black">====&gt; John: Flaaashbaaack</span></strong>
</p><p>
  <span class="black">The Case of <span class="rose">ROSE LALONDE</span></span>
</p><p><span class="john">JOHN: uh…r-roxy, why is rose…um…<br>
</span>
  <span class="roxy">ROXY: hey johnny remember how we talked about you wanting to being a dad<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: y-yeah, eventually, but…<br>
</span>
  <span class="roxy">ROXY: i know you wanna wait til were older thats cool<br>
ROXY: well rosey and me were chatting about things like that<br>
ROXY: and how she and kanaya cant have kids and all<br>
ROXY: so i was thinking…<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: oh god…<br>
</span>
  <span class="rose">ROSE: I think it’d be easier if I just get to the point for you, John.<br>
ROSE: And I promise, if the idea really makes you uncomfortable, I’ll drop it here.<br>
ROSE: But…I do eventually want to be a mother as well.<br>
ROSE: And after discussing the idea with Kanaya and Roxy, and getting both their approvals…<br>
ROSE: I wanted to ask you if you would do the honors, so to speak.<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: y-you want me to…uh, t-to…<br>
</span>
  <span class="rose">ROSE: I want you to impregnate me, John.<br>
ROSE: Again, this is just a request.  I’m not going to force you into anything.<br>
ROSE: If you’d rather not, or you’d prefer to wait until we’re a bit older to decide, that’s fine.<br>
ROSE: I’ll certainly understand and respect your decision, whatever it is.<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: um, well…wow, rose, that’s…<br>
JOHN: its an honor, and…but i’m not sure if…<br>

</span>

</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: also among your sexual conquests was a 
batshit insane supersprite that happened to contain a backup copy of 
rose merged with her dead cat and some tentacle shit<br>
DAVE: a being whose existence made no sense whatsoever but existed anyways so you said what the hell and fucked it<br>
DAVE: fucking kudos for that<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: i get it!<br>
JOHN: and don’t call them “conquests”, it just feels so fucking gross.<br>
JOHN: they’re all my friends…even vriska…just ones i’ve happened to have sex with thanks to my girlfriend’s wily ways.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: yeah thats fair sorry<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: plus it makes me feel like a manwhore or something like that.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: arent you though<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: what, no!<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: do i have to go back down the list of women who arent your girlfriend that youve had sex with john<br>
DAVE: its an impressive list<br>
DAVE: so impressive that im wondering more about the people who arent on it<br>
DAVE: like how havent you banged calliope yet I mean arent she and roxy super close<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: uh…well, roxy did bring it up, but…um, cherubs don’t really…<br>
JOHN: see, there’s this snake thing, and…normally, they don’t even have…you know…<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: oh no compatible parts got it<br>
DAVE: okay so the only way to resist the rolal orgy field is if you lack a vagina or vaginalike organ<br>
DAVE: makes sense i guess also explains why none of the guys have been pulled in yet<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: that’s…ugh, i give up.<br>
JOHN: i’m telling you though, i’m not trying to make this happen, dave.<br>
</span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: yeah i know<br>
DAVE: but giving you a hard time about it is a lot easier than coming to grips with roxy as a fucking polyamory goddess<br>
DAVE: like seriously is sexual divinity just part of being a lalonde<br>
DAVE: between roxys threesome bullshit and roses circle of girl sex<br>
DAVE: kinda makes me worry that its just something wrong with my side of the surviving genepool is all<br>
</span>
  <span class="john">JOHN: yeah, i…i guess i can see your point.<br>
JOHN: and i’ll work on getting better at resisting her wiles for your sake.<br>

DAVE: good excuse to hang out slash rip on you for that which will not be mentioned<br>
DAVE: that was still a thing right<br>

    </h3>


      <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>
  <strong><span class="black">====&gt; John: Be Dave</span></strong>
</p><p>You’d really prefer we not be Dave right now.  Hell, you’d really
 rather not be you either, given the current circumstances, and that’s 
an incredible achievement, given how awesome it usually is to be Dave 
Strider.</p><p>Not going anywhere else, though, are you?  Fine, have it 
your way.  You are in fact DAVE STRIDER now.  Alright, situation 
breakdown time.  You are currently at your friend John’s house, where 
you have just finished hassling him for his increasingly extravagant sex
 life.  Unfortunately, this hassling has brought several unsettling 
facts to light, most of which involving revelations about John’s 
girlfriend and your ectobiological mother, Roxy Lalonde.</p><p>Yes, it 
seems your hot mom has become something of a hedonistic deity with an 
inclination for threesomes in recent weeks, which has been the cause of 
John’s aforementioned sex life getting insane.  Most importantly for 
your current situation, you have learned that Roxy’s got a silver tongue
 (oh god, don’t think about Roxy’s tongue right now) when it comes to 
talking people into sex with her and John when alone in a room with 
them.</p><p>The REASON this information is important is because you now 
find yourself in John’s bedroom with just him and Roxy.  You have reason
 to suspect that, unlike what you previously thought, it was not John 
who invited you over today, when no one else would be home, but Roxy.  
Adding up this information, you have a possible conclusion in mind, one 
that is messing you up on more levels than you’re okay with.</p><p>…yeah,
 you’re pretty sure she’s gonna ask you to join John in fucking her.  
Like you said, you’re dealing with a lot of emotions about that, not the
 least of which is how said idea can be so insane and arousing at the 
same time.  </p><p>Nothing’s happened so far.  She joined you and John 
after the two of you finished shooting the shit about his non-stop fuck 
tour of human-and-troll-kind, and so far all you’ve been doing is 
chatting and playing a few video games.   She’s kicking your ass at the 
Mario Karts, more so than usual, but you’re slightly distracted by 
making sure to avoid any and all conversation topics that could lead her
 to talk about sex and threesomes and you having sex with her in a 
threesome.  </p><p>John, on the other hand, is putting up a decent 
challenge for Roxy, completely into it and having forgotten the whole 
“your girlfriend wants to add the other dude in the room to sexytimes” 
dynamic.  Basically just being John, adorable dweeb extraordinaire, a 
man whose nerdiness belies the fact that he’s probably put enough 
notches in his headboard to reduce the thing to splinters.  Y’know, if 
they were real notches and not a euphemism for all the sex John is 
having and dammit, stop thinking about John having sex.  You’re having 
enough trouble not thinking about sex with your smoking hot ecto-mom as 
it is, you really don’t need to add in dirty thoughts about your best of
 bros as well.</p><p>“So, Dave…” Roxy calls out to you, and your mind 
snaps back to the present, where you are getting destroyed in kart games
 and not thinking about sex with anyone in the room, not at all.  Roxy 
is so dominating this round that she’s not even looking at the screen as
 she starts talking.  “How’s things with you, bud?”</p><p>“Eh.  Things. 
 Can’t complain, y’know.”  You mumble something that sounds like a 
coherent reply.  Your eyes have totally remained on the screen and most 
certainly did not just glance over at Roxy and catch a glimpse of her 
incredibly creamy thighs peeking out of the short shorts she’s got on.  
Nope, you were laser focused on running your kart guy into this wall.</p><p>“All’s
 good in the land of cool kids and chill, then?  Good to hear……aaaaand 
boo-yeah!”  Roxy starts giggling to herself as her kart guy crosses the 
finish line in first, getting a groan from John as he’s still fighting 
with the computer players for second.  Roxy puts her controller down and
 stretches her arms above her head, and seriously you’re not scoping out
 how nice her chest is while she’s doing that.  “Haha…ha…so, Davey…got 
anything goin’ on in the roooomance department?” </p><p>Oh god, she’s 
talking romance.  Sirens are going off in your head.  Red alert, 
battlestations, try to think of something to say that’ll get her to have
 sex with you.  You mean not have sex.  You don’t totally want to have 
sex with this super-hot teen mom sitting on the bed behind you.  You…you
 need to think of something else.</p><p>Through all this mental anguish,
 you manage to keep your poker-face up.  Never let ‘em see you sweat.  
You quickly mutter back, “Nope.  Not really.”</p><p>“Awww, really?  No 
one’s gotten on the Strider train yet?”  Roxy lays down on the bed, 
stretching her legs out.  Eyes, stay forward.  Do not get pulled in by 
the amazing and barely clothed gams seriously those fucking shorts 
should be illegal.  Roxy sits back up, kneeling on the bed after a 
moment and shooting you a grin as she continues, “I’d have thought you’d
 have found yourself a nice ladyfriend by now…or something.  Actually, 
coulda sworn you and Karkat had something goin’ on, didn’t you?”</p><p>Oh
 thank god.  Seriously, thank you Roxy, there was no better way to throw
 water on this raging incest fire than to bring up that particular state
 of affairs.  “Nah…John asked me this a bunch, but really, we’re just 
bros.  Nothing that rises up to ‘goin’ on’, on any level.”</p><p>“Huh…really?”  Roxy cocks her eyebrow at you.  “That’s weird…we all thought there was def something up with you guys.”</p><p>“Nope…sorry
 to disappoint.”  You shrug back to her.  Honestly, in most 
circumstances, you’d rather not talk about the living embodiment of the 
words ‘it’s complicated’ that you and Karkat were involved in just 
before the game ended, or what is going on with you two now, if 
anything, which there isn’t.  But in this particular situation, you’d be
 more than happy to answer a million Vantas-related questions to keep 
your mind off other mom-lust related topics.</p><p>Roxy scratches her 
chin in mock-deep-thought.  “Hmmmm…interesting.  Well, what about Jade 
or Jane?  I know you hang with them a lot…and don’t try and play like 
you aren’t gawkin’ at ‘em all the time.  I remember you playing 
volleyball with those two on that beach trip few months back, and let’s 
just say your eyes weren’t exactly on the ball.”</p><p>“Yeah, pretty 
sure you’re just as guilty of eyeing up that choice Harley-Crocker 
bouncing yourself during that very same game, Rox.”  You glance back at 
Roxy with a smirk.  “Anyway, yeah, I’m not gonna say they’re not hot as 
hell because I’m not a filthy liar, but there is similarly nothing going
 on there, either.  Just a guy enjoying the fact that some friends of 
his are oblivious to their own sexual fox attributes.”</p><p>That gets a
 good laugh out of Roxy, and…huh, you just noticed that John’s gotten 
pretty quiet.  His kart guy crossed the finish line a while back, and 
he’s leaning back against the bed with a noticeable blush on his…</p><p>Oh.  Right.  He’s had sex with both of them, hasn’t he?  </p><p>Pretty
 sure all you’ve done here is jog John’s memories of said sexual foxes, 
probably ones that involve…y’know, actual sex.  And great, now you’ve 
got similar images circling in your head.  Cause that was just what you 
needed to deal with right now, images of Jade and Jane getting taken to 
the Ecto-cest district of Pound Town.</p><p>“Uh oh, Dave, looks like 
you’re bringing up the rear.”  Dammit, right, Roxy’s still here.  Away 
with you, images of unsettlingly hot dweebs fucking.  Yep, you’ve paid 
such little attention to this game that the race has ended without you 
crossing the finish line, as every other racer has finished, leaving you
 in last place.  Your kart guy shakes his fist angrily as he laments his
 loss, and you can practically hear him curse your name, knowing that 
you and you alone were responsible for this failure.</p><p>“Welp, I 
guess the old gaming skills are a bit off today.”  You toss your 
controller to the side and lay your head back on the bed.  Well, if 
nothing else, you’ve gotten away from romance talk and Harleybert 
fuck-thoughts.  “Good game, Rox.  Sorry John was the only one to even 
make it interesting, while I was just here finding new and inventive 
ways to drive into walls.”</p><p>“Always a pleasure to dominate you 
kiddies in the nintendos.  Come again anytime.”  Roxy flashes a broad 
smile as she lays down on her stomach, her head right next to yours.  
The three of you are all quiet for a moment, the only sound in the room 
being the noise of the game before John reaches the remote and shuts the
 TV off.</p><p>It remains silent for about half a second before Roxy turns to you and asks, “Anyways, hey Dave, wanna fuck?”</p><p>…huh.</p><p>……yeah, your ecto-mom just swerved right back to sexy-talk, didn’t she?</p><p>………surprisingly,
 your head’s actually pretty clear right now.  Aside from, y’know, the 
sounds of worlds colliding.  The whole of the cosmos shattering.  Time 
grinding to a halt.  You could go on.</p><p>Somehow, you’ve managed to 
keep your poker face up yet again.  Seriously, you could write a fucking
 book on never letting anyone see you sweat.  It’d be a best seller, 
which in this universe means all of ten people would read it, but still.
  You look over to Roxy and see that her face is as calm and cheerful as
 ever, as though she had asked you if you wanted to play a different 
game, not to have sex with her.  John, who you can see out of your 
peripheral vision, is blushing much harder than he was a second ago, but
 he hasn’t said anything yet.  Guess it’s up to you, then.  “Maybe I 
misheard you, but I’m pretty sure you should be asking John that.  You 
know, your boyfriend?”</p><p>“Yeah, guess you’re right…sorry, still 
figuring out how to approach this.”  Roxy rubs her head as she turns to 
said boyfriend.  “Hey John, you’d be down for a threesome with Dave, 
right?”</p><p>That is not the same question she asked you.  Not even fucking close.  </p><p>John’s
 a little lost for words at the moment, his mouth hanging open at first.
  He gathers himself after a second, rolling his eyes and bringing his 
hand to his forehead, but he doesn’t answer right away.  He’s thinking 
it over, hesitating a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 
“…sure.  I mean…yeah.  If you want to, Roxy, and if he’s okay with it, 
I’m game.”</p><p>What.  That wasn’t the answer you were expecting from 
John’s mouth, especially considering all the “Roxy had to CONVINCE me to
 do all that fucking” talk from earlier.  C’mon, John, the obvious 
answer there was, “Roxy, are you really asking to have incredibly hot 
sex with my bro who’s also kind of your son, cause that’s a little 
messed up”, right?</p><p>“Awww, thank you Johnny.  Mwah!”  Roxy leans 
forward and places a kiss on John’s cheek, which you would say is just 
the cutest thing you’ve ever seen if not for the context, y’know, the 
one that involves boning your hot mom.  She says, “So, Dave…interested?”
 as she turns back to you, and dammit why does that look seem so fucking
 hot right now.  She’s not even batting her eyelashes that much or 
anything like that, but there’s a little spark in her eyes which, 
combined with that incredibly cute smile that’s curled up on her face, 
is driving you crazy.  </p><p>Whatever it is, your poker-face is 
definitely shattered right now, and you are one hundred percent letting 
her see you sweat.  So much for that book.  Time to think about the new 
book, “Mom-lust: Irresistibly Hot Ecto-moms and the Cool Ecto-kids Who 
Fuck Them.”  A trashy romance novel, sure, but yet another best seller, 
one that sells millions of copies.  All of them to Rose, of course.</p><p>“Heheh…alright,
 I can tell I caught you just a lil’ bit off-guard.”   Roxy giggles at 
your obviously conflicted face.  “Okay, let’s back this up.  Try again 
from the top.  Ahem…hey there, Dave.  Davey.  Mr. Strider.  How’ve you 
been?  I know this might be a bit sudden, and trust me, you can say no 
at any time and I’ll stop right away, but you’re p hot and I’d totes 
like to have sex with you.  So, and again, only if you’re cool with it, 
how’s about a little three-way action with me and my boy Johnny over 
here, huh?”</p><p>“I…okay, hang on.  Give me a sex…fuck, I mean a sec, 
goddammit.”  Welp, if you had any cool left in you, that little Freudian
 slip sure finished it off.  Roxy’s laughing again, and John can’t help 
but join in as well.  Smooth job there, Strider.  “Alright, first thing,
 I need you guys to do me a solid and forget that just happened.  Can we
 start with that?”</p><p>“Haha…sure thing, just gonna need a sex 
myself…pffft, hahaha…”  Roxy gets about halfway through her statement 
before giving in to the urge to rip on that blunder, sending her back 
into a fit of laughter and getting John in as well and sure you guess 
you chuckled a little bit at your own expense.  Damn, she’s infective.  
“Okay, no…haha…alright, that was my bad.  Sorry, I couldn’t resist.  
‘Kay, I’m cool now.”</p><p>“Right…anyway, I was trying to say, before I 
did that awful thing that we’ll never mention again, that I’m kinda…I’m 
still trying to wrap my head around this whole…thing you two have going 
on.”  You sit up straight again as you start trying to work through your
 feelings on the matter.  “Like…I was giving John a hard time about it 
earlier…”</p><p>“And then some.”  John pipes in as he rolls his eyes at you.  “You did kinda accuse me of being a manwhore at one point, Dave.”</p><p>“…yeah,
 I was ripping John about it pretty good, I’ll admit.” You amend your 
previous statement.  “But I think it’s mostly because I don’t really get
 how it works.  The whole poly thing.  Like, I get why you enjoy it, and
 whatever works for you guys is fine with me, and…okay, I won’t play 
like I don’t think you’re also super-hot and it would be fucking amazing
 to have sex with you, ecto-cest and all…but I just want to know where 
you guys are coming from with this whole thing, and…shit, I’m not 
explaining this well, am I?”</p><p>“No, I get it, it’s okay.  Not gonna 
pretend like this isn’t a pretty weird situation for others.”  Roxy 
stops your rambling to reassure you.  “Here, I have an idea.  You ask us
 whatever you want about our whole poly thing, and we’ll try and explain
 it.  Give us the whole ‘lightning round’ biz.  And any time you decide,
 ‘this shit’s too weird, can’t deal with it,’ you can ollie outie and 
I’ll totes understand.  Whatever makes you feel comfortable, and all, 
right?”</p><p>“Yeah, because lightning rounds with you always turn out 
great for me.”  That got another chuckle out of her, and you’re feeling a
 bit more relaxed than you were a second ago.  “Yeah, alright.  I can do
 that.”</p><p>“Shit yeah, let’s get this lightning round goin’ then!”  
Roxy’s beaming again as she sits up, scooching back and patting the bed,
 inviting you to sit with her.  “Alrighty, Davey boy, whatcha wanna know
 first?”</p>

  <span class="black">====&gt; Dave: Initiate Lightning Round</span>
</p><p>“Alright…let’s see…”  You pick yourself up and take a seat on the
 bed, making sure to keep a nice, platonic distance between you and 
Roxy, while John sits down right next to her.  “I guess we’ll start at 
the top…what got all this started?  Like, what caused you to give the 
poly thing a try?”</p><p>“Terezi, basically.”  Roxy answers you pretty 
quickly.  “Like…okay, it was a while after me and John got together, 
really, when Terezi really started getting her hate-mack on.   That had 
been going on for a while, but then it started getting kinda intense, 
and John came to me and…uh…”</p><p>Roxy looked over to John, who gives a
 bit of a bashful blush before he continued, “Yeah, I…well, I guess I 
came to terms with the black romance thing a lot faster than I expected.
  I mean, Roxy was teasing me about our ‘beautiful hate’ for weeks, even
 after we got together.  But when Terezi told me she wanted me to 
actually…y’know, try the whole kismesis thing, I was worried that it 
might hurt things with Roxy.  So I went to see her and we just…talked 
about it.”</p><p>“He was pretty cute, all messed up inside and pouring 
his heart out and…”  Roxy was smiling as she remembered the 
conversation, but trailed off after noticing the embarrassed look on 
John’s face.  After a second, she chuckled and ruffled the boy’s hair as
 she continued, “Uh…yeah, I think you get it.  Anyway, we talked about 
it and worked things out.  I told Johnny that he should go and try to 
fill his other quadrants, even if it came to sex and all that, and I’d 
be fine with it.  And he said that if I ever wanted to do the same, he’d
 understand as well.  So John started hate-dating Terezi, and every now 
and then he’d come home with a whole bunch of scars, which worried me a 
bit but was also kinda fucking hot.  Which…uh, got me wondering how it’d
 be to get down with Rezi, and…”</p><p>“I’m just gonna stop you there, 
Rox.”  You put your hand up before Roxy can finish her sentence.  
“Considering what I got out of John earlier, and how Terezi couldn’t 
keep her mouth shut on all the three-way action she’s getting to save 
her life, I think I can guess what happens next.”</p><p>“Gotcha.  So 
yeah, we threesome, and hooooooooo-ly fuck was it good.”  Roxy’s smile 
goes ear-to-ear as she’s clearly calling up the memory.  “And basically,
 from there on out we were off and running on the 
threesomes-all-the-time thing.  Couple times a week, a couple whole 
weekends, the beach day…”</p><p>“Oh god, the beach day.”  John slaps 
himself his hand to his mouth in a futile attempt to stop himself from 
laughing.  “Even after everything that’s happened over the last few 
months, that’s still the most ridiculous thing I can remember.”</p><p>“…Wait.
  Hold on.  Let’s take a quick time-out, alright?”  You make a T with 
your hands, the universal sign for the Commercially-Branded Sports 
Time-Out™.  “Was there some other time you guys went to the beach by 
yourself?  Because there’s only one other ‘beach day’ I know of, and if 
you’re telling me that you two and Rez got down to business while I was 
building a sandcastle made of dongs to piss off Karkat, I’m going to 
have to start questioning every decision in my life.”</p><p>John and 
Roxy glance at each other briefly before Roxy shrugs and answers, “Hey, 
it was totally Rezi’s fault for not knowing she wasn’t wearing anything 
downstairs, okay?”</p><p>You go quiet for a bit after that.</p><p>Eventually,
 you shake your head and rub your temples a bit.  “Let’s put that one 
aside for now, because we could spend a whole fucking day going over how
 THAT bullshit happened.”</p><p>“Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.”  
John’s quick to agree.  “Basically, though, it’s like I said before, we 
got into the threesome thing because Terezi.”</p><p>“Sure, I got that 
much, but that doesn’t explain why you two started banging all the other
 girls, man.” You look back at John, who blushes again at the mention of
 ‘the other girls,’ before you shift your gaze to Roxy.  “Care to 
explain that one, Rox?”</p><p>“Can do, Davey.”  Roxy nods back to you.  
“So, a couple days after that beach trip, John here had a hate-date with
 Rez.  I was bored, so I gave Jane a call, and she wasn’t doing anything
 for the rest of the day.  So I’m like, shit yes, haven’t had a proper 
girls’ night with Janey in a good while, so we made a sleepover out of 
it.  So we were hanging out, playing games, then…uh…well, I had the 
bright idea to get revenge for the pillow fight we had the LAST time we 
had a sleepover…and…”</p><p>“Uh huh.  I’d guess what comes next, but I 
don’t feel like putting my approximate knowledge of the most obvious 
lesbian porn script ever on display right now.”  Now it’s Roxy’s turn to
 blush like crazy at your comment.  “So why don’t we skip past the 
specifics again.”</p><p>“Y-yeah, sure…”  Roxy nodded as she thought over
 what to say next.  “So…yeah.  Jane, man.  I always meant what I said 
about how hot Janey is, but I had never actually thought to put that 
to…uh…practice, I guess.  I don’t really know, maybe banging Rezi made 
me more conscious of girls, or I just got caught up in the whole 
sexy-pillow-fight thing, or…whatever.  But she looked damn hot, and I 
was kinda feeling the mood, so I went with it.  And…uh, right, skip a 
bit…then its morning all of a sudden, and I’m lying next to a super-hot 
naked Jane, and everything’s good…right up ‘til the moment I think ‘what
 do I say to John?’  Aaaaaaaaand then came a little panic attack.”</p><p>“Oh,
 so is this my turn to tease you for your heart-pouring-out moment?”  
John snarks at Roxy, getting a playful fist to the side for it.  “Heh, 
sorry, sorry…still, it’s only fair.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I hear ya…”  
Roxy rolls her eyes at her nerd before continuing.  “So…yeah, I’m fine 
now because it all worked out, but in the moment I was just fucking 
freaking out.  And I felt like I couldn’t talk to John about it, 
for…well, a bunch of reasons, obv.  But I still needed to talk to 
someone, so…”</p><p>You add things up in your head, and the answer seems
 pretty clear.  “Rose, huh?  Of course it was Rose.  Because how else 
would something like this get started without my ecto-sis getting 
involved?”</p><p>

<span class="rose">TT: I hadn’t been, but the Persterchum notifier on my phone was kind enough to rouse me.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I’d make a pithy observation about the early wake-up call, but I can see you’re already agitated enough as it is.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Might I ask what’s wrong?</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: im a fucking awful person is whats wrong rose</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: worst piece of shit this side of the universe</span><br>

<span class="roxy">TG: worst</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Mmhmm.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: And this completely untrue and ridiculous belief was brought about by…?</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: oh man what am i gonna dooooo</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i cant fucking believe myself and I dont know how im gonna face john at all and</span><br>

  <span class="black">at 6:24</span>
</p><p><span class="rose">TT: Sorry for the wait.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Have you managed to calm down a bit?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i guess</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: im still an awful fucking person but i think i can talk about it without losing my shit now<br>
<span class="rose">TT: If that’s the case, we can get back to the million-dollar question.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: So, what exactly did you do that would make you deserving of such a title?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i slept with janey</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and not slept slept but SLEPT slept<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: im saying we totes fucked<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: which would be great and WAS great except for the whole i have a bf and ur not him dealie<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and then i woke up in bed with a naked jane and realized im a fucking cheating scumbag and kinda started panicking<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and she woke up and couldnt believe we did that and we have no idea what to fucking do or what were gonna tell john<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: oh god rose what do we tell john<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: rose<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: oh no u think im a monster dont u<br>
<span class="rose">TT: No, that’s…that’s not it.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I’m sorry, the image of you and Jane naked in a bed together was a bit distracting, is all.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: And no, I don’t think you’re a scumbag or a monster for having sex with Jane, Roxy.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Is Jane still with you, by the way?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: yeah</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: pretty fucked up about it too tho<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and worst is shes only beating herself up because
 she thinks she messed up me and johns relationship when really its all 
my fault<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: she shouldnt feel guilty im the one who fucked everything up<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Roxy, I know it might seem bad right now, but I promise, you haven’t fucked everything up.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I’m not going to press you on the details, but it
 seems pretty clear that all you did was get swept up by your emotions a
 bit more than you think you should have.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: And you and I both know John well enough to know 
that boy has enough kindness in his heart to forgive you if you’re 
honest with him and tell him that.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: You are going to tell him, right?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: of course im gonna tell him</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i wouldnt fucking hide this from him thats fucking gross<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Then you’ve already proven you’re not a cheating 
monster or scumbag, or whatever other epithet you had cooked up for 
yourself.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: A true cheater would lie about it and hide their 
affairs from their partner rather than be honest and tell them face up 
and explain what’s going on.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: So by committing to talking to John and working 
through the issue together, you’ve already proven you’re not a scoundrel
 or anything like that.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Does that make sense?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i guess so</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but im still feeling kinda<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: man i dunno how to explain it<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: its just weird and i dont know what johns gonna say<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Honestly, I really don’t think you need to worry about what John will say once you tell him, Roxy.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Even if you were to leave aside the fact that he 
has a bigger heart than just about anyone else that we know, I have 
trouble seeing John, of all people, being one to get upset about you 
having sex with another partner.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: I’m fairly certain you and Terezi have been introduced, after all.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Quite intimately, if the latest gossip is any indication.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: hehe uh yeah i suppose u could call that being introduced</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but still tho thats a quadrant thing this was just<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: a plain ol ur hot lets fuck thing<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: dunno if itll be the same<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Probably not, but I think there’s a bit more in common than you’d think.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Certainly, kismesis relationships are an odd beast in and of themselves.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: As I’m discovering more and more, thanks to my own recent forays into the genre.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: lol yeah hows the spidertroll treating u</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I’ve got no complaints on that…wait, we’re getting sidetracked here.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I can share some stories later, but let’s keep focused for now.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: shit right my bad</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Anyway, my point was that, in order to accept 
quadrant relationships, you have to accept that it inherently means 
multiple sexual partners to a degree.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: You even told me you had a similar discussion 
with John when Terezi approached him about going official with their 
beautiful hate.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: That he was worried it’d be a type of cheating, but you assured him he was fine with it.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: And, in turn, he told you he’d be fine with you doing something similar.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Maybe your similar something just happens be closer to classic polyamory than quadrants?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: uh</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: poly huh<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: hmmmmm<br>
<span class="rose">TT: It’s not so far off, is it?</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: After all, it’s not as though this is your first brush with more casual sexual relationships.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: You and Terezi have had sex without John as well, right?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: yeah</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: a few times<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but not as many times as weve all been together for a threesome tho<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: either way its been pretty choice i won’t lie<br>
<span class="rose">TT: During any of those times, did you consider what you were doing to be cheating on John, or something he’d be upset about?</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: uh</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: not really???<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: like sure the first time it was just me and rez she was cackling about messing with John about it and i told her off<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: like woah not cool rez<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but ever since its just been<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: fun<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: two gals with the same bf bonding if you kno what i mean<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: often on top of said bf ;)<br>
<span class="rose">TT: And did your night with Jane feel similar to that?</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: uh</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: wow yeah<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i actually hadnt thought about it but yeah<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: just funs a p good way to describe it<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Then maybe that’s what you need to tell John.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Tell him you got caught up in the moment with Jane, but that this is a part of who you are.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Just like he was honest with you about his black 
feelings, you should let him know that you’ve discovered a budding taste
 for polyamorous relationships.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: If I know our Mr. Egbert, I have a feeling he’ll be quite understanding about it.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: yeah</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: yeah i think ur right<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: man im still nervous about it but i think…<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i think itll work out?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: thanks so much rose u da best<br>
<span class="rose">TT: You’re quite welcome, Roxy.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Now, you should probably see to calming Jane.  Reassure her that no one is at fault here, and that you’ll get through this.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: yeah ill do that</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: should uh<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: probably get some clothes on first tho<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and wow yeah im gonna need to find hers too<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: might be a lil tough while were both a little exposed yknow<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Yes, well…</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I think I can see how that would be distracting.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: lol u know it</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: hard to do real talk when those crockers r hanging out<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: just trying not to flashback n get sucked in again<br>
<span class="rose">TT: I suppose you must be back in good spirits, if we’ve managed to steer you back to lurid banter about Jane’s assets.</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: hehe yeaaaaaah</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: like i still know we messed up last night and i need to come clean bout it to john but the little voice in my heads all<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: she is super fucking hot and last night was fucking sweet<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: u need to do that again<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and i know i gotta push those thoughts out because its serious the fuck up time<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but theyre feisty thoughts<br>
<span class="rose">TT: I can imagine.</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: dang it there they are again</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: dammit jane y u have to be so fucking hot<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: cmon brain get back to john<br>

<span class="roxy">TG: yeah im</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: sorry im fine<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Are you sure?</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: You trailed off there quite suddenly.<br>
<span class="rose">TT: What happened?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: nothing happened im fine</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: just<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: mmmmmmmm how do i say this<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: kinda had an image fly through my head<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: aaaaaand it was<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: just the hottest fucking thing<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but probably a little hotter than i should be okay with tho???<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Well, my curiosity’s peaked.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Care to go on?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: uh</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: k just dont tell anyone else<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: invoking total lalonde secrecy rule here<br>
<span class="rose">TT: The Total Lalonde Secrecy Rule is heard and acknowledged.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: My lips are sealed to all non-Lalonde ears.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: ok</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: so<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: ive told you about how much fun its been having these threesomes with john and rezi right<br>

<span class="roxy">TG: well i mean everything i say about it<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: its just fucking amazing and i love everything about it<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but one of my favorite things is watching john as hes fucking rezi<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: just something about the look on his face or his little moans<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: things i miss when hes fucking me because my brains kinda busy dealing with how incredible it feels<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i dunno but it just drives me crazy<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Mmmhmm.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: I can see the appeal.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: so</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: like i said i was trying to get my mind off janes hot bod and think about john and real talk<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but my brain decided to just add john to sexytime thoughts with jane<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and suddenly im there in that incredible moment but instead of rezi moaning under john its jane<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: and<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: gooooddaaaamn<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: its just too much and im so turned on and its really not the time but fuuuuuuuuck<br>

<span class="roxy">TG: yeah</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: but<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: even leaving aside the fact that its my bf and one of my bffsies<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: probably shouldnt be super turned on by thought of john fucking his mom should i<br>

<span class="rose">TT: I mean, of course, it’s…<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Sorry, I can’t lie.  That is an incredibly arousing image, and I kind of got lost in it for a moment.<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: i kno right</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Though I can also understand the ecto-weirdness involved in such a situation…um…</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Do you…<br>

<span class="roxy">TG: wut</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: you mean like<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: do I want to get john and jane together for a threesome<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: like in real life<br>
<span class="rose">TT: Well…yes.</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Assuming I’m right and John is his lovably understanding self about polyamory…<br>
<span class="rose">TT: It isn’t outside the realm of possibility that you could interest him in a threesome with partners besides Terezi, is it?<br>
<span class="roxy">TG: ………</span><br>
<span class="rose">TT: Roxy?</span><br>
<span class="roxy">TG: hoooooool-ey fuck yes</span><br>

    <p>
  <span class="black">====&gt; Roxy: Go back to being Dave</span>
</p><p>…yeah, of course it would be something like that.</p><p>Rose just
 had to say one thing too many, and just like that a powder keg of 
sexual energy gets unleashed.   Then again, by this point you’re getting
 the idea that powder kegs of sexual energy is basically her and Roxy’s 
aesthetic.  These goddamn Lalondes, man.  </p><p>“…so then I go meet 
with John, and…well, let’s skip over all that jazz for the time being.” 
 Roxy’s got an awkward smile on her face as she finishes her little 
recap of her talk with Rose.  She glancing over to John, her smile 
widening at his quickly reddening face, before she looks back to you and
 segues right back to the fun stuff.  “Anyways, yeah, the next day, me 
and John have things more or less figured out, and Rose comes over to 
make sure we’re doing okay.  One thing led to another, and…”</p><p>“Yeah,
 I got this part from John.  All of it that I want to hear, anyway, so 
don’t worry about filling me in on all the mom-daughter sandwich 
positions you decided to trot out that day, alright?”  You quickly 
respond before Roxy can go any further.  Not that that completely stops 
her, as she’s giving you a knowing smirk and goddammit what does she 
think she’s doing with those hand gestures.  Oh my lord.  Quick, look to
 John.  Yes, John, your absurd levels of blushing are the correct 
response here.  Thank you for getting us through this.</p><p>“All right,
 I’ll spare you the hot fucking deets.”  Roxy sighs and shakes her head,
 but the smirk doesn’t leave her face as she scooches closer to John and
 wraps her arm around his waist, pulling him in to an embrace.  “Point 
is, I figured my shit out and John was pretty comfortable with my…uh, 
experimenting, so I figured I’d experiment some more.  Me and Janey had 
another fun night not long after, then a couple days later, I invited 
her over here, and…”</p><p>“Yup, got this one too.  Hot moms in your 
bed, whatcha gonna do.  Heard it.”  You slap your hand to your face to 
try and keep your thoughts away from any and all thoughts of that 
situation.  Nope, not working.  You’re cold thinking bout Crocker 
bouncing on John’s cock now.  Roxy’s right, that image is unsettlingly 
white-fucking-hot.  “Fast-forwarding again.”</p><p>“Oh, what, booooo.”  Roxy starts mock-razzing you.  “Am I gonna get to tell any of these stories?”</p><p>“Nope,
 we’re good.  Don’t forget, this is my lightning round, you agreed to 
that.  So cut it out.  Stop thinking bout that Jade story right the fuck
 now.”  You roll your eyes, though you doubt she noticed because your 
hand is still covering your face.  </p><p>“Mmmmm…fine, fine, I get it.  
Well, not that it’s much of a lightning round, since it’s only been a 
couple questions so far.”  You hear Roxy giggle a bit at that 
observation.  Damn, she’s right, you got caught up in that and didn’t 
keep up your end of the lightning round deal.</p><p>“Right, right.  
Lightning round’s back.”  You drop your hand from your face and fold 
your arms in your best serious-business pose.  “So, you and Jane a 
thing, then, like John and Rezi are?”</p><p>“Not really.  It’s always 
pretty casual.”  Roxy shrugs.  “We still hang like usual, just every now
 and then those hang-outs end with us in bed.  That’s all.  Gotta be 
honest, it’s pretty fun once you get to the point where it stops being a
 federal fucking issue when you have sex.”</p><p>“Mmhmm.  I’m sure.”  
You try and keep up your serious business shtick, adjusting your shades 
in a no-nonsense way.  “And you’re cool with John doing the same?  Even 
with girls who aren’t Terezi?”</p><p>“Yuuuup.  One hundred million 
percent.”  Rox’s grin gets about as wide as possible.  “Even asked him 
to take pictures, but that’s usually a no go.  I have to settle for 
stories after.  Well…most times…”</p><p>“Oh god, John, please tell me 
there are pictures.  Wait, shit, I mean don’t tell me that.  And I don’t
 want to see them, that’s be super uncool, so please don’t show me 
them.”  Your serious shtick collapses in an instant as soon as the 
concept of visual evidence of John’s sex tour of the surviving humans 
and trolls comes up.  You’re really hoping he doesn’t…</p><p>Huh.  Actually, John’s being pretty quiet all of a sudden.  You expected some kind of comeback, but he’s just kinda…</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Why does it sound like he’s breathing a little heavy?</p><p>……Wait.</p><p>Oh
 god, Roxy’s hand is in his pocket.  And it doesn’t take much to figure 
out what those little movements going on there are all about.<br>
Your brain’s on red alert again.  Battlestations are manned.  Sexy-time 
combat has officially been initiated, with an opening foray of pocket 
pool.  And…yeah, you have no idea how to handle this fucking situation.</p><p>“Hmmm…well,
 why don’t we leave these potential photos aside for now.”  Roxy smiles,
 noticing that you’ve realized what she’s doing.  Not that it’s stopping
 her, as she turns to John, who you’ve finally decided to notice is 
having a really hard time keeping cool about the fact that he’s getting 
jerked off right now.  “The point is, I’m fine with whoever John decides
 to get down with, same way he’s cool with my biz.  In fact…been a while
 since we checked in on that.  Hey, John, out of curiosity…since that 
time with Rose, which was…what, almost three months ago?  Anyway, since 
then, how many times have the two of you gotten together?”</p><p>“Nnnn…uh…”
  John’s struggling with…well, a lot of things, really, but whether to 
answer that question is among them.  After a moment, he finally spits 
out, “F-five…no s-six times.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s about what I’d figure.
  I’ve been with Janey seven times since this all started, so six with 
Rose sounds right.”  Roxy nods as though anything she just said made 
sense.  “Funny, I actually think that’s the same number of times I’ve 
been with Kanaya…and its not always when you and Rose are getting down 
and she’s bored.  Speaking of, how bout Kanaya, John?  How many times 
you been with her?”</p><p>“Ha-Haven’t been.”  John shakes his head, 
still stammering a bit as he speaks.  “She’s not…not interested if you 
or Rose aren’t there.”</p><p>“Really?  Huh…she seemed to enjoy it during
 that threesome…and those times both her and Rose were here…”  Roxy 
trails off, just casually dropping that implication of a four-way like 
it was nothing.  “Whoops, off-track.  Right, stay focused, Lalonde.  
Okay, John, how about…Janey?  How many times you been down with the 
momlust, Johnny?”</p><p>“Th…three times.”   John hesitates for a second,
 as he glances to you, and you’d swear he’s looking a little more 
embarrassed as he looks away again, if that’s even possible.  “Same 
w-with Jade, before you ask.”</p><p>“Not counting the times they were 
both…”  Roxy starts speaking, but John quickly nods his head to keep her
 from finishing the statement.  Not that it mattered at that point, 
because you got the gist.  John fucked his mom and sister at the same 
time.  Also, Roxy was probably there, too, so that’s three out of the 
four human girls at once.  He was a Rose away from another crazy fucking
 achievement, probably something like “the Full Egbert” or whatever.</p><p>Also,
 wow, you had no idea you could be this hard with absolutely nothing 
being done to you physically.  A rather large amount of your mental 
capacities are currently focused on thinking the un-sexiest thoughts you
 can possibly think to stop you from jizzing in your god-tier jammies.  
You don’t know if you can launder that shit out, and you’re really not 
interested in finding out right now.</p><p>“Okay…hmm, who else…”  Roxy 
is seriously not helping right now, constantly giving you these sultry 
little glances as she continues to test John in more ways than one.  
“That’s all the human ladies, and you tell me all the times you’re going
 to see Rezi, so…Vriska?”</p><p>John goes pretty quiet here.  He’s 
breathing pretty heavily as Roxy keeps up her diligent hand-work, but 
you can tell he’s unsure of what to say here.  Roxy gets a bemused look 
on her face as she leans in closer to John, her smirk widening as she 
patiently waits for an answer.  Finally, John grunts out, “N…nine 
times.”</p><p>Roxy whistles and lets out a little laugh.  “Dang, Johnny, you got that spidertroll all wrapped around your finger, doncha?”</p><p>“Wa-wasn’t
 my plan!”  John protests a bit, though the way he’s leaning back while 
Roxy continues to rub him off isn’t helping him look convincing.  
“Sh-she’s been the one coming over all the t-time since we…since the bet
 thing, and…”</p><p>“I know, I know, just messing with ya, hon.”  Roxy 
leans in again and plants a quick kiss on John’s cheek. “Seriously, that
 girl’s like the kid who got to ride her first roller-coaster, and now 
she keeps going back and getting in line.   Rosey tells me she uses it a
 lot when teasing Vris on their hate-dates.” </p><p>John tries to 
respond, but all that comes out is an “Ooooh, fuuuck…” and his face 
scrunches for a second.  You…yeah, you’re pretty sure that’s a “don’t 
blow it, don’t blow it, DO NOT BLOW IT” look there.  You should probably
 help the dude out.</p><p>You clear your throat loud enough to get both 
their attentions, then quickly state, “Hey Rox, not that I’m not finding
 your torment of John highly entertaining, because it’s pretty 
hilarious, but it if you don’t pull back just a bit, you’re gonna have 
at least one pair of messy god-jams to deal with.”</p><p>“Heh, yeah, 
think you’re right there, Dave.”  Roxy laughs again, finally pulling her
 hand out of John’s pocket, as the boy lets out…something that’s a bit 
of a relived sigh with a tinge of regret.  Roxy glances at her hand a 
bit, kinda…reminiscing, maybe?  Not sure if you’re reading her face 
right, but whatever she’s doing, there’s a sultry look on her face that 
is just doing incredible things to you right now.  It only last a 
second, though, before she looks back at you and says, “So, Dave, I know
 lightning round kinda got sidetracked a bit, but…I’m kiiiiinda ready to
 go here.  Think Johnny is too.  And it, uh, looks like you’re right 
about there with us.”</p><p>You don’t even need to look down to know 
that you’re standing at a completely full mast over here.  “Yeah, s’pose
 I can’t deny that.”</p><p>“Right…so, uh, again, you can say no at any 
time and we’ll stop, but…”  Roxy makes sure to add that get-out-of-jail 
free statement, but you recognize the nervous note in her voice as she 
says it, one you pretty quickly identify as the “you can but please 
don’t” tone that you’re also adept at.  She super wants this, but she’s 
too nice to not leave you an out in this situation.</p><p>…if you wanted it, of course.</p><p>“I
 get you, Rox…just…one more question, though.”  You glance at her for a 
sec before you switch your gaze back to John.  “John…and I know you’ve 
said it before, but really just wanna be absolutely, no-doubt fucking 
one-hundred percent sure.  Last time, no backsies…you’re cool with this?
  This won’t make things…weird between us?”</p><p>“…hah…ha, what, 
like…there was a ‘normal’ between us?”  John finds the energy to crack a
 joke as he catches his breath, laughing at his own joke and…alright, 
you admit, you kinda chuckle a bit.  Damn this nerd and all his adorable
 charms.  He’s still laughing a bit before he finally goes, “Yeah, Dave,
 I’m good.  Promise you, this won’t make things awkward or anything like
 that.  You’ve got my word.”</p><p>You take a deep breath, letting it 
out slowly before you go, “Okay then.”  And just like that you scooch 
over, sitting closer to Roxy and giving her a smirk.  “So…how we doing 
this, Rox?”</p><p>Her face lights up, and damned if it’s not the most 
attractive look you’ve ever seen, even counting all the sultry looks 
she’s been tossing your way today.  She seems to consider it for about 
half a second before reaching for the hem of her god-tier top, pulling 
it up with one motion.  </p><p>She is…not wearing a bra, is she.</p><p>Welp, guess you can’t say you weren’t ready for this.  Yeah…yeah, those are your mom’s tits. Fucking A, man.  </p><p>She
 stands up, and her hands go to her shorts and wow, that didn’t take 
long.  She is not a time-waster, is she.  Shorts and panties are off in 
one motion, and goddamn, that ass is choice.  You’ve usually tried to 
avoid getting distracted by moms and their hot asses, but you think 
you’re allowed to enjoy the view for a moment.  You don’t get long, 
however, before Roxy kicks off her garments and glances back at you and 
John, wiggling her eyebrows as she says, “Boys, this party has a very 
strict dress code, and you are not meeting it.  Why don’t you go ahead 
and start fixing that?”</p><p>Can’t resist that invitation.  You quickly
 glance to John and give him a shrug, as the two of you stand up at once
 and begin disrobing.  Hoods, capes and shirts come off fairly quickly. 
 Your hand hesitates for a moment as the grab your jammie pants, though.
  Come on, cool kid, you’re just whipping out your cock in front of a 
super-hot DTF girl who’s also your biological mother and your best 
friend who happens to be her boyfriend.  Seriously, nothing to get 
worked up over.</p><p>And…yep, pants are gone.  Hey there Lil’ Stride, 
you look ready for action.  Alright, cool, now don’t look to your left 
and you’ll be goddammit, you looked.  Fuck, John’s huge.  Why.  Oh god, 
why.  Only two dudes your age in the entire fucking universe to compare 
yourself too, and one of them’s a shouty alien, so you’ve got this in 
the bag, right?  Nope.  Now you know you don’t stack up.  And shut up, 
reasonable part of your brain that’s trying to remind you that John’s 
really not that much bigger, and even if he is you know you’ve got a 
good sized cock anyway, seriously you got out the fucking ruler and 
checked for yourself and…</p><p>Okay, time to stop making Sweet Bro and 
Hella Jeff cracks in your head.  You want this boner to stick around for
 a while.  And you want to be able to look back at your masterpiece 
without immediately thinking of that time you fucked your mom.</p><p>Fortunately,
 all those things you were thinking about get thrown out of your head as
 the sensation of gentle fingers wrapping around your cock blasts every 
other thought away.  Roxy’s looking down at you as she gives you a light
 little tug that’s doing way too much to you right now.  She ain’t 
looking disappointed at all, either.  She looks up at you, a sly smile 
on her face as she whispers, “Why hello there, Mr. Strider.  Eager, 
aren’t we?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t be right to turn down a lady’s invitation, 
would it?”  You try to snark back at her, and god, you hope she’s 
laughing because that came out as smooth as it sounded in your head and 
not because you stumbled your way through it.  You’re not really sure 
what’s happening around you right now, cause every sense in your body is
 focused on what’s happening downstairs.</p><p>She is laughing though, 
so you guess it wasn’t too bad and ooookay she’s leaning in and kissing 
you now.  Okay, all other thoughts need to leave again.  Focus is 
required, as your arm wraps around her waist, as you pull her close and 
kiss her back.  She giggles into your mouth as you start returning the 
kiss and you really need to make her to do that again.  Of course, she’s
 still got her hand on your cock, and she teases the head in juuuust the
 right way to pull a moan and a “fuuuck” out of you, causing you to drop
 the kiss.</p><p>Roxy chuckles lightly again as she pulls back, biting 
her lip a bit as she looks you over and admires the effect she’s having 
on you.  Then she looks to your left and oh right, John’s here.  It’s 
amazing how getting a handjob makes you forget some rather important 
things.  Looks like John’s getting a similar treatment, as Roxy’s other 
hand is working his shaft (seriously stop comparing dicks you idiot 
focus) and pulling some sighs out of him.   She leans in and give him a 
kiss too, surprising him a bit as his eyes had started to close, but 
he’s quickly giving it back to her.  </p><p>It’s just a brief smooch 
before she pulls away, and she looks down at the dicks in her hands a 
bit, that sly look on her face again.  She mutters, “Hmmm…now that we’re
 here, I kinda wanted to know what it’s like…” before her head starts 
lowering and oh god, she’s on her knees.  She’s kneeling down with a 
cock in both hands.  That’s it, you’re in a porno now, you’re sure of 
it.  There’s a director around her somewhere yelling at some beleaguered
 assistant that the lighting on those dicks better be fucking right, he 
swears to god…</p><p>Wait.  She’s kneeling down with a cock in both 
hands.  You’re quickly reviewing the pornos with a similar situation 
that you certainly haven’t seen in your head, and you’re pretty sure 
what happens next issssss fuuuuuuuuck.</p><p>The sudden wetness making 
contact with your dick makes your whole body shudder and brings you back
 to your senses.  You look down, and Roxy’s tongue is lightly licking 
you from the head of your cock down the shaft, as she looks up at you 
and smiles.   You have absolutely no way to deal with this.  Your body’s
 pretty much on autopilot right now, as your hand reaches out and 
ruffles through her hair as you try to hold back highly unsexy grunts.</p><p>Not
 that you’re able to resist for long, because as her tongue makes it 
back to the head of your dick, she brings her lips to the tip and starts
 slooooowly sliding you into her mouth.  And holy fuck, you are not 
prepared for this.  Imagining a blowjob in no way prepares you for 
actually receiving one.  All you can do is mutter “oh fuuuuuck” and her 
head starts lightly bobbing on you, occasionally shooting you a glance 
before her eyes close again as she enjoys the moment.</p><p>You are 
currently a hot fucking mess.  Most of your brain is being overloaded 
with the fact that you are getting blown right now, the parts that 
aren’t are shouting ‘hey our moms sucking us off are we sure thats ok’, 
and any remaining brain cells that aren’t caught up in all that are 
desperately trying to stop you from unloading in her mouth right here 
and now.  You don’t know how you’re gonna hold out for…oh.</p><p>She 
pulls back from your dick, making an extraordinarily satisfying ‘pop’ 
sound as it come out of her mouth, before she looks to John’s dick and 
does the same to him.  His face scrunches up, and he immediately starts 
muttering, “Oh fuck, Roxy, I……mmmmmmgh…” before his resistance crumbles 
from Roxy’s pressure.</p><p>Your brain has returned to 
slightly-more-functional levels, and there’s a lot going on in there.  
First off, hey, Roxy’s still stroking you off, and man, that is still 
fucking great.  Second, you really weren’t expecting the parts where 
Roxy focuses on John to be as hot as this, but you are so not 
complaining about it.  Something about the pleased little sounds she’s 
making that you’re just noticing now because you were kinda preoccupied a
 second ago is driving you wild, and the way John is responding to her 
every little move is just making what you’re seeing that much better.</p><p>Then
 again, there’s a not-so-small part of you that just desperately wants 
her to come back and give your cock her attention again.  You know she 
will, obviously, but there’s still this incredible burning desire that 
you can’t reassure flaring up right now.  Maybe that’s what’s making 
this feel so hot?  You want her, god, you want her, and you know she’ll 
be back, but that still doesn’t make the waiting while she tends to John
 any less excruciating.  But goddamn, she looks good doing it, and…</p><p>There
 is literally no part of anything you’re thinking right now that makes 
sense.  All you know is this feels way better than it has any right to. 
 It’s obvious to everyone that you have completely and utterly succumbed
 to the momlust.  And right now, all you can do is wonder what the hell 
took you so long.</p><p>There’s that impossibly sexy ‘pop’ again, as 
John’s member slides out of Roxy’s mouth. She turns back to you and 
wastes no time pulling you back in, sliding waaaay further down your 
cock than she did a second ago before she slowly draws back, her lips 
and tongue sliding down your member as she goes.  Once she makes it back
 to your tip, she starts sucking you again, letting out a soft moan on 
your cock that just about does it right there.  It is taking every ounce
 of willpower in your body to not blow it.  </p><p>Roxy glances up at 
you again, and you notice that you’re gripping her head a little tight, 
just sorta guiding it down your shaft, apparently.  You pull it back as 
she pulls her mouth off your cock, again with that incredible pop, 
taking a breath quickly before she mutters, “How’m I doing, Dave?”</p><p>“A…A-plus-plus,
 Rox.”  You ruffle her hair as she giggles and god, giggling should not 
be so fucking sexy.  “Suh-seriously, just…fucking dump out all the 
pluses, they’re…they’re all yours.”</p><p>“H-heh…good.”  Roxy smiles 
again, continuing to pump her hand on your dick as she looks back to 
John and starts sucking him off again.  He groans deeply as she draws 
him in, and she bobs on his shaft with a good tempo.  Seriously, if 
that’s what she was doing to you, you have no idea how you managed to 
hold out so long.  John’s clearly feeling it, as he starts moaning 
pretty loudly as she picks up the speed…</p><p>“R-Roxy, wait, 
I…fffffuuuuuck!”  John suddenly grabs Roxy’s head, shuddering violently 
as Roxy’s head stops, her lips remaining tight on his cock as he holds 
her close.  Her eyes shut, and you hear her moan against him as…</p><p>…yeah, you just watched John cum in Roxy’s mouth.</p><p>There’s
 a small part of you that’s just happy you didn’t do that, but you shoo 
it away pretty quickly because seriously, not cool.</p><p>John falls 
backwards a bit, sitting back down on the bed, Roxy’s mouth still on his
 cock.  Sure that he’s finished now, she starts drawing her head back, 
letting you hear the ‘pop’ one last time as she releases his cock from 
her mouth.  There’s a slightly dazed look about her as she looks up at 
John, her mouth still half-open, his hand still caressing her head, and 
you can just kind of make out a drop of John’s white cum trailing from 
her mouth when she closed her lips and oooookay she just swallowed his 
cum.  Dammit, you should have looked away, but you didn’t and now you 
know the answer to the question you never wanted to think about.</p><p>Ignorant
 to your inner anguish, Roxy picks herself up and sits on the bed next 
to John, airily asking, “Guess my…my foreplay game was a la-little too 
strong today, huh Johnny?”</p><p>“Huff…maybe…’m sorry, Rox…”  John’s 
face is an incredible mix of emotions right now, incredible relief and 
post-orgasmic glow mixed with frustration and disappointment in himself,
 emotions that should be on opposite ends of the spectrum but managed to
 come together in this one specific situation.  “Shoulda…shoulda tried 
to hold out a little…”</p><p>“It’s okay, John…”  Roxy rubs his shoulder,
 leaning in giving him a light peck on the cheek.  “I did it too…shoulda
 held off a little on the pocket pool, maybe.”</p><p>John’s still 
looking a little disappointed, but he’s not looking quite as depressed, 
and he seems to have cheered up enough to crack a joke, pointing to his 
cheek and saying, “Hey, careful, still got something right here…”</p><p>Roxy
 thinks for a bit before reaching out and mussing his hair hard, 
playfully retorting, “Ohhhh?  A little ‘what’ exactly, Johnny?  I can’t 
tell, maybe you could lick it off for me…”</p><p>John laughs back, which
 quickly spreads to Roxy.  It’s pretty cute, you admit, but it’s hard to
 really join in, especially because of your own impossibly hard boner, 
which has yet to…</p><p>“Haha…ah, hey, Dave, sorry for leaving you 
hanging.”  Roxy calls out to you, still mussing with John’s hair.  
“Anyways…nightstand, top drawer.”</p><p>Your brain takes a second to 
traverse the sexy-haze hanging in your head and process that statement 
before you turn to the nightstand sitting next to the headboard.  You 
walk over and open the drawer to reveal……</p><p>………yeah, it’s just a fucking mountain of condoms, isn’t it.</p><p>You
 pick up one of the unmistakable foil wrappers, looking back to the bed 
where Roxy is sitting.  Or was sitting, as she releases John and starts 
laying down on her side, looking straight at you, totally silent as her 
eyebrow arches up just a bit.  Still pretty naked, you remember to add 
for no reason, really.</p><p>Your brain has to shout at you to be GENTLE
 with that fucking wrapper, god, IT DOESN’T MATTER HOW FAST YOU OPEN IT 
IF YOU RIP THE DAMN THING.  Maybe you hear that, or maybe you’re lucky, 
but either way you manage to extract the condom without damaging it and 
start rolling the rubber down your shaft.</p>

    <p>
  <span class="black">====&gt; Dave: Assess current situation</span>
</p><p>Right.  Situation assessment time.  Okay, let’s focus.  Get down 
to business.  Break things down here.  C’mon, let’s do this.  Alright, 
here’s the sitch…</p><p>…You’re about to fuck your mom.</p><p>That’s all there is to say on that matter.</p><p>……okay, maybe you could go on just a little more.</p><p>Alright,
 so you’ve got a condom on, first off.  Safe sex and not knocking up 
your ecto-mom are important.  You’re quadruple checking to make sure 
it’s fine, no rips, no tears, okay yeah you’re good.  John got over his 
early pop-off pretty quick, and has squirmed his way behind Roxy, 
rubbing her tits and playing with her nipples.  That’s getting a few 
soft coos out of Roxy, who turns her head back and meets John’s lips in a
 cute kiss.  </p><p>You’d rather not jump their fun with heavy thrusting
 right away, but fortunately, you had a better idea.  You put your hand 
on Roxy’s hips and start lightly kissing around her navel, slowly 
working your way down as she squirms under you.  Finally, your lips 
reach her nub, which you suck on an extra little moment before you 
finish your journey and start running your tongue on her slit.  Her 
squirming quickly intensifies as you attack her most sensitive spot, and
 she moans loudly against John, who keeps up his own teasing.</p><p>“Mmmmphhfffuuuck…”
  Roxy disengages from John’s mouth as you slide your tongue up to her 
nub again and start licking and sucking at it again.  “D-dang, 
Davey…yuh-you sure you’ve never done this shit be…before?  Nuh, not 
gonna lie, it’s…fuuuuuck…it’s p good, hon.”</p><p>“Mhah…yeah, pretty 
sure.  This’s just base-level Stride goin’ on here.”  You take your 
mouth away from her clit and grin as you look up at her.  “I know, it’s 
hard to be this awesome.  As always, you’re welcome for me existimmmph.”</p><p>“Yeah
 yeah, that’s enough outta you.”  Roxy reaches out and grabs your head, 
pressing your mouth back down into her crotch.  “Now get back to what 
you were doing, it’s a much better use of your mouuuUUOOOHHH GOD FUCK.”</p><p>Welp,
 she did ask you to get back to what was working.  So you grabbed her 
hips and started eating her out as hard as you could, sticking your 
tongue into her and swirling it around as much as you could.  You aren’t
 lying, this is kinda new to you, but that’s not to say you haven’t…uh, 
studied for the test, y’know.  Never know when a pop quiz in sex might 
happen, so it pays to keep reviewing the material.</p><p>The material 
being porn, and the reviewing being cracking off to said porn.  In case 
that wasn’t clear.  Hey, you’re unexpectedly eating a girl out and doing
 a pretty decent job of it, if those moans mean anything.  Guess it 
means it wasn’t for nothing.</p><p>You continue to tongue Roxy with as 
much force as you can, as John keeps working those nips and trailing 
kisses down her neck.  Guess the combined pressure on her sensitive 
spots is too much for her, because it’s only a minute or so before she 
starts tugging on your hair and quickly muttering, “Nnnnguuuuh…o-okay, 
good job there, now heel, boy.”</p><p>You lift your head up at her 
urging, giving a mock whimper in response to the heel command, though 
you’ll admit you’re just the tiniest bit happy she did, your tongue was 
getting tired.  You wipe your mouth, which had become rather wet with 
your saliva and Roxy’s…yeah…before you give her another smirk and ask, 
“So, how’d I do, Rox?  I have an invitation to visit that district 
again?”</p><p>“He-hell yes on the invitation…might even snag VIP 
treatment.”  Roxy’s still catching her breath as she responds.  “You did
 good, kiddo.”</p><p>“Yeah?  Alright, cool.”  You’re feeling a little 
calmer than you were a second ago.  Nothing like the ‘you did good at 
sex’ ego stroke to soothe the nerve.</p><p>“I’d say you did pretty good,
 Dave…well, you had to be better than the last our last threesome 
newbie, at least.”  John joins in the conversation again, taking his 
mouth Roxy’s neck.  “That time was…yeah…did you know that Jasprose has 
these little barbs on her…”</p><p>“Oh god Johnny please don’t say 
anything else I’m gonna have flashbacks.”  Roxy gives John a light jab 
in his shoulder as she slides down and lays on the bed.  “Changing 
topics, now…so, Dave, you didn’t think I pulled you up because we were 
done, didja?”</p><p>That little bit of conservation had brought you to 
the funtimes zone for just a bit, but before you know it, you’re right 
back in sexytimes-town when you notice that Roxy is spreading her legs. 
 More to the point, one of her hands has made its way down to her slit, 
spreading them open as she gives you the hottest fucking come hither 
look you’ve ever seen.</p><p>…yep.  No turning back now.  Of course, you knew that a while ago.</p><p>You
 pull yourself up and scooch forward on your knees until you’re…well, 
until you’re in position, really.  You wrap one hand around one of her 
legs, using the other to guide your dick into Roxy’s welcoming hole.  
You slide juuuuust a bit of the head in, and already you can feel her 
warmth and how fuck there is no way you can handle this.  You might not 
have been getting a handy for much of the last half hour like John, but 
you’re crazy on-edge and ready to blow and you don’t know if you can…</p><p>“Mmmmnnn…”  </p><p>…woah.</p><p>Any
 thought that had been in your head just got kicked out the window.  Any
 worries or fears of disappointing or anything like that, yeah they’re 
all gone.  The only thing on your mind right now is “Oh god that was 
fucking hot and you caused that and you need to make her do more of it.”</p><p>So
 you waste absolutely no further time and push yourself into her as deep
 as you can.  You manage to keep enough of your senses to not shove the 
whole thing into her too fast, but it’s all one movement, one nice, 
steady thrust in until your hips connect.  </p><p>And…uh…yeah.  </p><p>Look,
 there’s not gonna be a lot of incisive commentary here.  Your entire 
mental capacity, usually split between being cool at all times, dropping
 science like a stone cold mothefucker, making sweet as fuck comics and 
occaisional dabbling in knightly heroism, is now completely focused on 
not being immediately overwhelmed by the unbelievable warmth and 
tightness that your cock is currently sheathed in.  And oh fuck, there 
are those moans again, as sweet and incredible as anything you’ve ever 
heard and goddamn how does John manage to stop doing this with Roxy long
 enough to get anything else done in his life you’re gonna blow FOCUS 
MOTHERFUCKER.</p><p>Oh hey, technically you are a motherfucker right 
now.  Huh.  Guess John is too.  Has been for a while, really.  And, oh 
yeah, Roxy always considered Rose her mom, didn’t she?  Didn’t stop her.
  Wow, an entire room of literal motherfuckers.  You’re just proud to be
 a part of it.</p><p>“Mmmaaahh…fuuuuck…”</p><p>But yeah, there’s no way 
you’re lasting very long.  Not with what you’re feeling and those sounds
 she’s making right now.  There’s a T-minus countdown going on 
somewhere, and you don’t know what number they’re at now but you’re damn
 sure it ain’t a high one.  So you better make whatever time you’ve got 
to enjoy this count before you achieve liftoff.</p><p>So you start pulling your dick back just a bit <span class="dave">hold it</span> and start slowly working your hips.  Roxy’s breathing <span class="dave">hold it</span> gets more ragged as you start to buck against her, but her smile widens as she mutters words of <span class="dave">hooold it</span> encouragement in between her moans.  John’s kneeling besides <span class="dave">hold iiiiit</span> Roxy’s head, muttering something that’d you’d be able to hear if <span class="dave">hold it</span> you could hear anything besides Roxy right now.  The only thing <span class="dave">HOLD IT</span> you manage from him is a yelp of surprise, and out of your <span class="dave">HOOLD IIIT</span> peripherals you can see that Roxy’s head’s in John’s lap, her mouth around his cock as she moans against his <span class="dave">FUUUUUUUCK</span>.</p><p>You
 can tell it’s coming.  You don’t know how long you’ve been going at it,
 since all other senses have left your body right now, but you know 
you’ve reached the end.  You feel your body start to unspool, and in 
your last seconds before the finale, you buck your hips a little harder 
and faster than you had been, until the moment arrives and you drive 
yourself as deep into Roxy as you can and literally everything goes 
white.  </p><p>………hang on, give it a second, your brain’s rebooting.</p><p>Okay
 things are starting to come back.  First thing you notice is the sticky
 feeling around the head of your cock.  Yeah, there was really no 
escaping that, was there.  Next thing is you feel Roxy’s body under you,
 as you sort of collapsed onto her.  Should stand up and get off her…is 
the thing you thought you’d do, but your legs are a bit jello-y at the 
moment, so you just manage to push yourself off her and roll off to the 
side.  You roll onto the bed, quietly thinking a few words of thanks to 
John for having a big bed, cause otherwise you’d probably have rolled 
right onto the floor.  </p><p>You’re feeling pretty satisfied, what with
 the whole post-orgasm bliss and all, but you’re already looking over to
 Roxy, hoping that to see the “you did a good job and im totes not 
disappointed” face.  And fortunately, she’s happy to oblige, looking 
over to you with an incredibly beautiful smile on her face.  There’s 
just something about that look and her slightly heavy breaths that puts 
you at ease.  She lifts herself up on one arm, sitting up against the 
headboard as she mutters, “Woo…really went at it at the end there, huh 
Dave?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah, was kinda going on autopilot there.”  You can 
feel your face warming a bit, as you reach to wipe the sweat off your 
brow, and it’s only now that you realize you never took your shades off 
during the whole thing.  You’re…you’re not sure how you feel about that.
  Sure, you look better with the shades on and everything, and they 
never fell off, so damn, you’re good, but there’s a little nagging voice
 in your head that’s saying they should have come off before you got 
down to business, and it probably looked pretty weird.  Then again, you 
weren’t exactly thinking straight a second ago.  </p><p>What with all the thoughts of losing your virginity and all.</p><p>Which was pretty great.</p><p>“No
 complaints here, I was enjoying the ride…mmmmmn…” Roxy lifts her arms 
up and stretches, and your eyes are quickly drawn back to her tits and 
dammit, why weren’t you playing with those while you were fucking her.  
Another missed opportunity.  And now you’re starting to get annoyed at 
yourself for thinking more about the things you messed up.  You just 
turned in your V-card, so what if you weren’t porn-star smooth during 
the whole thing.  Maybe next time you’ll…</p><p>Wait.  “Next time”? 
Okay, brain’s functioning again, and it’s reminding you to get your shit
 together and get back to Dave Strider, Chill Motherfucker if you ever 
want there to BE a next time, which oh god yes please…</p><p>Calm down.</p><p>Shit together.</p><p>Chill Motherfucker.</p><p>And you’re not even overreacting to the double entendre there anymore.  Okay, you’re good.</p><p>“Mmmm…ahh…”
 Roxy finished her stretch, as she looks back over to you and wiggles 
her eyebrows a bit.  “So, how the post-virgin life feeling for ya, Dave?
  Turning in the V-card given you a new perspective on things?”</p><p>Man,
 she really doesn’t fuck around, does she.  “Well, I think I’ve got a 
good idea why everyone you’ve gotten in the freak zone with wants 
another trip or seven, so there’s that.  Oh, and yeah, that shit was 
incredibly fucking choice, Rox.  Can definitely see the appeal of this 
whole sex thing, which sure, I always had an idea that there was 
something to it, but still.”</p><p>That gets a laugh out of her.  Okay, 
good, you’re doing the right thing.  Then she turns her head and right 
John’s still here seriously stop forgetting that, it’s not cool.  
Anyway, she looks to John and asks, “So…I did hear you saying that you 
saw the appeal, didn’t I…?”</p><p>“Uh…well, even if I wanted to say no, 
which I don’t, I don’t think you’d believe me, considering…”  John’s 
rubbing the back of his head in that super anime way as he points down 
and yep, there’s Lil’ Egbert at full mast.  Awesome how you got to look 
at that again, though at least you’re not doing your full freak-out from
 before.  Chalk another victory up to the power of getting laid.</p><p>Still,
 there’s a little part of this conversation you don’t think you’re 
getting.  You give Roxy a glance and ask, “What’s all this about 
‘appeal’, now?”</p><p>“Oh, that…I mentioned how I find the look on 
John’s face when he’s in the bone zone super-hot, right?  Well, John 
wasn’t sure what that would be like the other way around, since seeing 
me with another girl really isn’t the same thing, you know?”  Roxy gets a
 little mischievous smile on her face as she answers you.  “Was part of 
why I thought about adding a boy into the mix, instead of a girl.”</p><p>“And
 I won’t lie, I think I can see where she’s coming from with that.”  
John’s still got a bit of a bashful look on his face, but it’s becoming a
 bit more mischievous as well as he reaches an arm around Roxy’s waist 
and brings her a little closer to give her a quick kiss, which he breaks
 before continuing, “That said, you’ll forgive me if I say I prefer 
being involved more than watching, won’t you?”</p><p>“Mmmm…I might, if 
you keep that up…”  Roxy gives him a smile before swinging a leg over 
John and straddling his hips.  “That said, think I’d like to take charge
 for juuust a bit here…you guys have both made it to the finish line, 
but I’ve still got a bit to go, you know?  And that just doesn’t seem 
fair, does it?”</p><p>“Uh…” You and John both share a sheepish look.  
She’s kinda got you there.  At least you’re in company in the early 
pop-off club, you guess.</p><p>“Phhhahaha…sorry, just messing with you 
boys a bit.  Don’t worry about it too much…besides, it feels like we’re 
already ready for round two, aren’t we?”  Roxy’s eyebrow arches again as
 her hips start bucking ever so slightly, sliding her slit on John’s 
cock as he moans in response to the gentle movements.  “Mmmm…yeah, I 
think you’re good to go…or, er, almost…uh, hey Dave…would you mind…?”</p><p>“Gotcha
 covered, Ro-Lal.”  You quickly reach your arm out to the nightstand, 
pulling the drawer open and grabbing another condom, which you hand to 
Roxy in a quick motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Thank you very much…”  Roxy 
grabs it from your hand and quickly starts removing it from the wrapper.
  As she does, she looks over to you, her hips still bucking, and says, 
“Oh, and don’t feel you have to, like, give us time or anything like 
that…you can jump in whenever you want, hon.”</p><p>“I know…just need a few seconds.”  You shrug back to her.  “Gotta recover a bit, do some…uh, cleanup…y’know.”</p><p>“Mmhmm…alright.
  Well, lemme know when you wanna tag back in.”  Roxy nods as she slides
 her hips back, John’s member perking up as she slides off of him, which
 elicits another grunt from the kid.  She takes the condom and starts 
rolling it down John’s cock...man, you want her to do that for you.  
Another thing for next time, assuming you get there.  Still working the 
Chill Motherfucker routine to get there.  Which is a lot harder at the 
moment, as you’ve still got a spent condom on your cock, and you should 
probably deal with that.</p><p>You take the condom off and start looking
 around for the trash and some tissues to, uh, clean yourself, but 
you’re still paying attention to the action through the occasional 
glance in that direction.  Well, John’s got the condom on, and Roxy’s 
making sure it’s on good…or just giving John another hand job.  Could be
 both, come to think of it.  “Mmmph…fuck, Roxy, that’s…”  John grunts 
are starting to get a little desperate as Roxy continues to tease him, 
and his hips buck up a little bit into her hand.</p><p>“Hehe…alright, I 
guess I’ve had my fun…oh, Dave, there’s some tissues in the second 
drawer on that night stand.”  Roxy calls out to you, recognizing that 
there’s no tissues in plain sight.  You give her a thumbs up and open 
the drawer, which contains a couple packs of tissues, along with some 
batteries, bandaids and other assorted knick knacks.  Nothing too out of
 the ordinary, though you guess the pile o’ condoms in drawer number one
 had you wondering what else they kept in here.  You’ve grabbed one of 
the tissue packs and are trying to open it, but its slow going as your 
attention snaps right back to Roxy as she lets out a sigh and murmurs, 
“Now…mmmn…think you’ve earned a l-little rrrmmmphfuuuuuck....”</p><p>You
 shoot another glance back and sweet lord, this view.  Roxy and John 
shifted around a bit while you were preoccupied, and you’re looking 
straight at Roxy’s ass, which just started to sink down on John’s cock. 
 Their hips connect smoothly just a moment later, and Roxy takes a 
second to let out a pleasurable coo before she starts bouncing on his 
dick, slowly at first, but already she’s starting to pick up the pace.  
John’s hands work his way onto her hips, and he grips her tight as he 
starts thrusting up, matching pace with her movements as her coos start 
turning into moans.</p><p>You…oh, yeah, tissues.  You should…shit , why is…FUCK…dude no look no…it’s NOT THAT HARD…JESUS DICK.</p><p>Wow, it’s hard to open a pack of tissues while not looking at them.  But you’re having a hard time looking away.</p><p>Somehow,
 you manage to pull your eyes away from the seriously hot fucking going 
on to open the tissues like a normal person, pulling a couple out 
quickly and starting to clean off your unsurprisingly hardening cock as 
your eyes snap back to the action.  Yup, she’s still riding him and that
 ass is still going up and down and is just about the hottest thing 
you’ll ever see.  The pace has picked up to the point that the bed it 
starting to squeak under them in that “anyone downstairs is gonna be 
kept awake by this” kind of way.</p><p>Your gaze flicks away for just a 
second to toss the condom and tissues in the trash bin next to the bed, 
and then bam, it’s back.  Man, they’re going at it.  Roxy stops her 
up-and-down movements for a moment to swivel her hips, extracting some 
nice grunts from John before she gets back to the bouncing.  Damn, it’s 
good, and…whoa, hey, when did you start jerking off to this?</p><p>Roxy 
leans back a bit now, still bouncing up and down, but needing to support
 her body with her hands as she’s moaning harder.  It’s still hot, but 
you’re not gonna lie, you much preferred the last position, as this one 
gives a less clear view of her hips.  Even before you gave in to the 
momlust today, you’ve scoped out her HOT ASS every now and then, usually
 beating yourself up about your Freud issues…at least when Rose wasn’t 
“helping” in that regard.  Of course, you’ve stared at her behind more 
than a few times as well, because fuck, the Lalonde ass is simply a 
miracle of the universe.  Trying to deny the obviously because of pesky 
biologically-related details is stupid.</p><p>Roxy turns her head to 
glance back at you, her smile only widening as she notes that you seem 
to be enjoying yourself.  She arches her eyebrow, and that’s all the 
invitation you need to scooch closer and wrap your arm around her, 
grabbing her chest and giving her boob a nice squeeze.  She moans as you
 squeeze her, which quickly turns into a giggle as she reaches for your 
face and brings you in for a kiss.  You swirl your tongue in her mouth, 
noting that it’s a bit harder to do that well while she’s getting rammed
 from underneath, and kiss her back as she sighs in her mouth and 
fuuuuck that’s so fucking good.</p><p>Roxy separates after a second, her
 eyes glancing down quickly as she pulls back.  She gives you an 
approving smile as she comments, “L-looks like…you’re re…ready again, 
a-aren’t ya?”</p><p>You don’t need to look down to know how right she 
is.  You continue to massage her breast as you respond, “Yeah…think it’s
 time I tagged in for round two.  So…how should I…”</p><p>“Hmmm…”  Roxy 
looks like she’s thinking a bit…it’s a little harder to tell expressions
 with a person who’s also getting fucked.  But it looks like she decided
 on something, because there’s no mistaking that smirk as anything but 
mischievous scheming.  “I’ve g-got an idea…if yuh-you’re interested…?”</p><p>“Uh…I
 guess I am, Rox.”  You glance down at John, whose face you can see 
again from your current position, but his eyes are locked on where he 
and Roxy are connected at the moment.  So he’s probably not paying that 
much attention to your conversation.  You shrug, looking back to Roxy 
and continuing, “I mean, we’ve come this far, so…”</p><p>Before you can 
finish, she grabs your head and leans in, bringing her lips up to your 
ear.  Your first thought is damn, her breathing on your ear all 
sexy-like is great, but you manage to focus enough to actually hear her 
when she whispers to you, “N-nightstand…second drawer…in, in the 
b-back…”</p><p>She lets go of you, giving you a wonk before she returns 
her attention to working her hips against John again.  You’re already 
shifting back over to open the nightstand’s second drawer again, even 
though you’re curious as to what she’s getting at.  The back of the 
drawer?  You didn’t notice anything before, but you reach your hand 
behind the tissues and batteries and start rummaging around…</p><p>You find it pretty quickly.  Huh, there’s…feels like a bottle?  You wonder what that is as you pull it out…of…</p><p>…oh fuck.</p><p>It’s…it’s
 a bottle, all right.  There’s liquid of some kind in there.  There’s 
words on the bottle, but your brain’s not really picking up on all of 
them quite yet.  Except for the one word, the one that kind of jumps out
 at you, for no particular reason.  </p><p>The one that looks oddly like “Lubricant”.</p><p>…and you’re not sure, but you’ve got a feeling it looks like “Lubricant” because it actually says “Lubricant”.</p><p>Which means you’re holding a bottle of lube, aren’t you.</p><p>Your
 mouth is hanging open a bit as you look back to Roxy.  She’s looking 
back at you as well, her smile widening even more as she sees the 
realization written on your face.  It’s at this moment she decides to 
lean forward again, riding John while leaning over him, in that 
incredible position where you can see the whole of her ass as she 
bounces on John.  </p><p>She turns back to John and kisses him sweetly, 
moaning into his mouth, and you see a little trail of drool linger as 
she pulls her lips away.  Then she glances back to you again, a smile on
 her face, as her hand slides onto her ass, the ass she knows you’ve 
been staring at this whole time.  She caresses her own ass for just a 
second, and her smile widens as she spreads her cheeks juuuust enough 
for you to get a little glance at her asshole.</p><p>You…you think you’ve got the idea.</p><p>You just…need a second.</p><p>Your brain’s stopped working again, is all.</p>

    <p>
  <span class="black">====&gt; Dave: You.  Roxy.  Lube.  Make it happen.</span>
</p>
<p>Dave has made it pretty clear that the higher functions of his brain 
are not properly functioning at the moment, so he cannot respond to your
 request right now.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could wait until his brain gets its shit together?</p>
<p>
  <span class="black">====&gt; Dave’s brain: Get your shit together.</span>
</p>
<p>
 <span class="dave">DAVE: shiiiiiit</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: fuck this is just</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: goddamn</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: …Hey.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Y’alright there, Dave?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh sure</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: everythings great</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: nope nothing weird going on in this</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: wait</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: dirk</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Yep.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry to crash your brain, man.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: you can do that</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, sorta.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: how does that even work</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: is this like a telepathy sorta thing</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Kinda.  It’s complicated.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Aspect-related powers and shit.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Basically, it’s a projection of my personality formed by your memories and ideas of me as a person.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: And, since it functions as yet another fucking 
splinter of my personality, it’s got some semblance of independence from
 your brain, and I can kinda link my main self to it in certain 
circumstances.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Gotten better at it, but it’s such a weird fucking thing it’s hard to really get a total hold on it.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: can you do this to everyone</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Not really.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I mean, theoretically, it’s possible, but I 
find that my brain splinters only gain independence in people who have a
 well-formed idea of me as a person.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: If that makes sense.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: So far the only ones I can do this with are you, Jake, and Roxy.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Your brain’s much more awesome to hang in than English’s, by the way.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: fucking of course it is</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: are you like</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: here all the time</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: in our brains</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: paying attention to what were doing</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: like specifically what was going on a few minutes ago</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Nah.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: It’s fucking tiring to keep this up for more than a few minutes.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Also, hells of privacy bullshit to go with being in your brain all the time.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I only dropped by because my splinter in your 
head was like, “Yo, Dave’s freaking the fuck out, might be an awesome 
time to try and help him out.”</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: The details of said freak out were left rather vague, however.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: So what’s up?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh nothing much</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: things are great</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: cant think of anything worth the level of freak the fuck out going on in round these parts</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Alright.  Cool.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: So, now that the obvious lies are out of the way, what’s up?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: ffuuuuuuuck</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: just</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: sure you wanna go down this rabbit hole</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: its a hole full of pretty visceral images is all</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I’ll deal.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: right cool</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: so</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: im naked at the moment</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: get that out of the way</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Alright.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Naked bro’s not a great place to lead off, but I can shrug it off.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Go on.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: ok then next is</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: im not the only naked guy in the room</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Oho.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: The plot thickens.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: aaaaand</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: theres also a naked girl in the room as well</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Mmhmm.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: That narrows down the possibilities.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Can I take a guess?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shoot</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: John and Roxy?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: got it in one</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: cant believe you figured it out so quick man</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: that shit is just incredible</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I know, it’s unreal how those names were the first to come to mind.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: It’s as if we don’t have that many friends at the center of a polyamorous maelstrom of near-constant coitus.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: anyway i just had sex with roxy</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Uh huh.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Kinda guessed we were building to that conclusion.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Uh…grats on the sex, I guess?</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Not really an expert on the protocol here, if we’re being totally honest.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah still working out whether to focus more on the just had sex part of the statement</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: or the with my mom part</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Is that what’s causing the freak-out?</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: The ecto-cest thing?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: nah ive pretty much gotten through that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and the sex was fucking sweet so no regrets there</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: current situation tho</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Go on.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: should i paint a fucking picture for you</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Fuck yes.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: alright</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: roxys riding john into the sunset right now</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shes also bending down and presenting her ass to me</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: after telling me to get a bottle of lube</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh did i mention im holding a bottle of lube right now</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: You did not.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: This is new information you have just submitted.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: well i can guarantee that information is one hundred percent truth</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: lube is in hand and its purpose has been made abundantly clear</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and that is the situation at this time</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: back to dirk with commentary</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Well, Dave, I can honestly say that I didn’t see that one coming.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Aside from you getting drawn into that particular fuck cyclone, writing was kinda on the walls there.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Still, making the jump to double penetration on the first try.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Say this for Roxy, she’s no time waster.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Striking while the iron is hot and all.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Assuming the iron is hot, and Lil’ Stride isn’t still down for the count.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh quite the opposite</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: if anything lil strides pulling double time</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Awesome.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Also, I’m gonna need you to do me a solid and 
agree to lock those last few sentences in the vault, because I’d rather 
not recall acknowledging that we both use the same nickname for our 
dongs.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: done fucking deal</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Cool.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: anyway</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: kinda wanna double back to what you just said</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: about writing on the walls</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Oh, yeah.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I’m sure this is probably surprising to you, 
but Roxy tends to go a bit overboard when it comes to sharing intimate 
details about her sex life during our conversations.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: nooooo</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I know, fucking shocking, right?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: next you’ll tell me she uses obscene little hand gestures while oversharing</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Beat me to it.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Anyway, during one of these TMI-laden convos, she may have mentioned certain people she finds super attractive.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: I won’t bore you with the full list, because it
 more or less goes on forever, but let’s just say a few varieties of 
Strider made it on said list.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: And, considering her skill with getting into 
the beds of the ladies she put on the list, the fact that she’d aim for 
some Stride sooner or later was probably inevitable.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: cant really deny that from here</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: did she</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: ever ask you</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Nah…well, not since all this started, that is.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Any propositions Roxy has sent in my direction 
were from a long time ago, and I’m pretty sure she kind of regrets those
 ones for a variety of reasons.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: By which I mean she’s apologized to me for it on numerous occasions.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Not that she really needed to, though it’s a nice gesture.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: And all that noise is probably why she’s 
declined to invite me on her current endeavors…along the other, more 
obvious reasons, of course.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: guess that all makes sense</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: so</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: now what</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Now what what?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: still got this lube my hand</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: ass is still waggling in invitation</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: what advice do you have o great brain bro</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Well.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Are you into it?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Wait, actually, don’t answer that, more info than I’d prefer.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: My point is, I can’t be the one to tell you to go for it or bail, man.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Up to you to decide whether you’re okay with 
going forward with this next, undeniably large step, or if it’s more 
than you can do in one day.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Knowing Roxy, I’m sure she’s told you a bunch of times that she’ll be cool with whatever you decide.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: So…that’s what you’ve gotta decide.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Are you into it or not?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: guess i kinda knew that already</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: but freakouts arent really the best time for rational thoughts to break through</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: You cool, then?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: As always, man.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Sweet.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Sending a mental “you got this shit” fist bunp your way, bro.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: got it and secured that bunp</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: were good here</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: right now get outta here its personal biz time</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: No prob, making brain-tracks as we speak.</span><br>
<span class="dirk">DIRK: Later.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="black">====&gt; Dave: YOU.  ROXY.  LUBE.  MAKE IT HAPPEN.</span>
</p>
<p>Hey, cool it, alright?  Dave just got his brain to start functioning 
again, no reason for you to start shouting at him.  Which is to say, no 
need for you to start shouting at you, because you are once again DAVE 
STRIDER.  In your hand, a bottle of lube.   Before you, a wiggly hot-mom
 ass.  In your head, you sincerely HOPE no brain images or whatever of 
your bro-dad, the one who you just gave you a cool-down talk in your 
mind to get you to stop freaking out over the lube/ass shenanigans.</p>
<p>A cool-down talk that only took about a second or so in real time.  Because you’re both just that awesome.</p>
<p>Granted, though, it was a solid second or so where you just kinda 
stared blankly at Roxy’s incredible ass, long enough for Roxy to think 
you might be having second thoughts.  She’s still bouncing away on 
John’s cock, but she’s looking back to you now, and while she’s still 
excited about the situation, you can tell that there’s some doubt 
starting to work its way into her mind.  The “oh no I went too far too 
fast and now he’s way freaked out shit shit shiiiiit” look is starting 
to show up.</p>
<p>And you’ve gotta say, you don’t care for that look.  You’ll take 
happy Roxy over disappointed Roxy every day of the goddamn week.</p>
<p>And you decide that you’re gonna let her get back to happy Roxy.</p>
<p>So it’s a little awkward.  What part of this night hasn’t been?  You 
signed on for a night of weird-as-hell moments, either moments of 
mom-fucking or moments of watching said mom get fucked.  And fuck, both 
of them have been pretty fucking sweet.  All you’re doing now is sorta 
mixing those two moments together in one neat package.  </p>
<p>You’ve made up your mind.  You don’t say a word, you just give Roxy a
 smile as you reach your free hand out to her, caressing her hips as 
they buck against John.  The sad-Roxy look is blown away in an instant, 
and she smiles back to you as she slows her hip movements, leaning back 
again and reaching out to you.  You meet her and bring your lips to 
hers, and you kiss her hard for a moment, as her hand makes her way back
 to your cock and fuuuuuck her hand still feels great on your…</p>
<p>Wait.  Hold that thought for a moment.</p>
<p>You separate from Roxy for a moment to look back down at your dick, 
which is not wearing a condom at the moment.  Remember?  How you had to 
throw it away after it got…uh, spent?  That’s still a thing, isn’t it?  
Fortunately, John’s got a bajillion of em in this fucking nightstand 
here, so you lean over and try to grab one, all smooth-as-hell.</p>
<p>Try being the operative word, as a combination of your awkward 
position, your legs still being just a little tired from your last round
 of fucking and Roxy’s hand still working on your junk makes your legs 
fail to do as you want, causing a magnificent chain reaction that causes
 you to fall right off the bed, the lube rolling past your head…the cap 
still on tight, thankfully, as you don’t think you’d like to find out 
how well that shit cleans up right now.  </p>
<p>You’re…you’re just glad Rox let go of Lil’ Stride in time.  That could have been much worse.</p>
<p>Well, it’s still bad, of course.  Hearing Roxy and John laugh at you 
still hurts.  Oh, sure, the sound of you fucking falling like a loser 
made them snap out of their sexy-fugue to make sure you were okay, but 
as soon as okay-ness was established, their moods went from worry to 
cheerful giggling pretty quick.</p>
<p>Which, to be fair, you’d do the same to them if that happened in 
front of you.  And you have, though in situations where clothes were 
still on, naturally.</p>
<p>Whatever, you’re a big enough guy to shake it off.  You get up, still
 chill as a motherfucker, and grab a condom from the nightstand quickly.
  Fortunately, despite the embarrassment of a few seconds ago, your dick
 is still at the ready, so you roll the condom on, pick up the bottle of
 lube that fell on the floor and retake your position behind Roxy.  You 
reach your arm around her and glance at both her and John while you say,
 “Alright.  So, no one saw that, and we’re right back in sexy-times.  
Right?  That’s what we’re doing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Haha…s-sure thing, Davey…heee…”  Roxy’s still failing to stifle 
giggles, but she’s twitching in response to your hand caressing her 
stomach again, especially when you start sliding down towards her more 
sensitive spots.  “Mmmm…o-okay, serious, I’m go-good…ahhh…”</p>
<p>“Oh, man…w-wow…Roxy, you just got…uh…”  John’s looking up at Roxy, 
but his glance is shifting to you…specifically, to the lube you’ve got 
in your hand.  He stares at it for a sec before looking up to you 
and…uh, Rox did clear this with him before putting her asshole on 
display, didn’t she?</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s only a second before you have to wonder that 
question, because John looks up at Roxy and shrugs, “Okay, y-you were 
right…guess he’s fine with it.”</p>
<p>“T-told you, Johnny…mmm…”  Roxy says what she can, still squirming 
thanks to your fingers and John’s rod.  “No…no way Davey was passing 
this up…with all the staring he’s been…”</p>
<p>“Alright, that’s enough of that…”  You decide you’d rather not have 
Roxy finish that, and give her a playful smack on the rear.  Not hard, 
but enough to get her attention.  </p>
<p>And it does that…quite well, in fact.  You can practically see her 
shiver from the slap, and John grunts loudly under her as well.  
“S-shit…Oh man, Roxy, I almost…fuuuck…”  John whimpers a bit as he tries
 to keep his composure, continuing to mumble, “Ufff…D-Dave, you should 
hurry I might not…shiiit…”</p>
<p>“Huh…guess that worked better than expected…”  You smirk, storing 
that one away for later as you pop open the lid of the lube bottle.  You
 squeeze a little bit of the clear liquid out and start smearing it over
 the condom, making sure you’re good and ready before you slide behind 
Roxy and get yourself in position, your hands on her hips.  You lean in 
next to her ear and whisper to her, “Well, I guess John’s good, so…you 
ready for this?”</p>
<p>Roxy’s breathing heavy, but she’s mostly calmed down from that slap 
as she turns to you with and impossibly sultry fucking look on her face.
  “Y-you bet…I am…”  She breathes out airily, her hand sliding back and 
spreading her cheeks for you again.  “Come and…get it…tiger.”</p>
<p>God, you’re not even doing anything, but just her look has you on edge.  Time to get moving, before you miss your chance.</p>
<p>You grab you dick and get it into position, gripping her hips as 
tightly as you can as you prod her asshole.  She sighs loudly as you 
press against her, followed by a loud, wanting moan as she shakes her 
ass juuuust a bit against you, desperately begging you to do it already.
  And you know you need to do it as well, otherwise all your gonna end 
up doing is blow it right here.  You push your hips forward again, 
pushing through the resistance until your dick slooowly starts sliding 
into her oooooooh gooood.</p>
<p>“FFFFFUUUuuummmpphh…”  Roxy practically screams as you enter her, 
collapsing onto John and letting her intense moans be muffled by his 
shoulder.  John, for his part, is scrunching his face mightily, as you 
can imagine Roxy’s tightened up on him like crazy.</p>
<p>And speaking of tightness HOOOLY SHIIIIT is this tight.  The pressure
 on your dick right now is off the goddamn charts.  Her ass is squeezing
 you like crazy, and even with the condom on you can feel her intense 
fucking heat wash over you entire fucking body and you…you…</p>
<p>Yooou are not going to last long.  Better make these few moments count, motherfucker.</p>
<p>You start working your hips immediately, sliding in and out, quickly 
increasing your speed until your hips are pretty much crashing into 
hers.  She’s moaning with each thrust, her head still in John’s shoulder
 as she grips his shoulder in one hand and the bedsheets in the other.  
You can tell John’s probably not far behind you, and he seems to have 
the same idea as you as well, as you can feel him start bucking his hips
 under her, which only increases the pressure on your dick and brings 
you ever closer to the finish line.  </p>
<p>“Mmmph…goddamn…”  Your grunts are getting more desperate, and one of 
your hands goes to Roxy’s shoulder, gripping her tight as you continue 
to thrust into her.  You’re slightly more lucid than you were during 
your first ride, but not much more, as once again fiber of your being is
 focused on holding out for as long as you can.  At least this time 
you’re not hyper terrified of being disappointing, since A) you and John
 are kind sharing the workload for this one and B) it’s pretty obvious 
Roxy’s barely hanging on herself.  </p>
<p>In fact, it’s just now that she’s gathered the strength to lift her 
torso up from John’s shoulder.  She mumbles something you don’t quite 
catch as she manages to steady herself in the classic doggy style 
position…er, from where you’re standing, it probably looks a bit 
different from John’s point of view.  You glance down at John, and the 
first thing you notice is that he’s blushing pretty hard as he looks up 
at Roxy.  You only notice that for a fraction of a second, because it’s 
quickly overridden by your next observation – that John’s hips have 
mightily picked up the pace, and Roxy’s ass has gotten even tighter as 
he bangs his cock up into her.</p>
<p>“Oh holy…fuuucking…”  You grip Roxy even harder as you’re now 
struggling to avoid popping off right here.  Roxy’s body lifts up again,
 and she’s leaning into you, which gives you the opportunity to wrap the
 arm that had been holding her shoulder around her stomach, holding her 
as close to you as you can.  You put your head next to her ear and 
mutter, “Sh-shit, Rox, dunno how much longer…I…mmmng…”</p>
<p>You barely get through your statement when Roxy turns her head to 
you.  You’ve got a glimpse of her face, and hoooo fuck you can see why 
John lost his shit.</p>
<p>There’s nothing jokey Roxy’s look, no smirk, no wiggling brows, 
nothing.  The only thing on her face is a look of intense enjoyment, a 
smile of pure satisfaction mixed with her incredible moans and the 
slight tears forming in her eyes…fuck, she looks completely fucking 
irresistible to you right now.  She could tell you to do anything for 
her, and you’d do it before you realized what it was she asked you.  </p>
<p>Which is good, because she’s trying to tell you something.  She leans
 up to your ear, barely able to get her words out, but eventually she 
just manages to mumble to you, “Dave…g-go…ahead…d-do it…”</p>
<p>Welp.  How you gonna say no to that invitation, cool kid?</p>
<p>You’re not, obviously.</p>
<p>All common sense and restraints get kicked out the fucking window, 
and you thrust into her as hard as you can.  Your hips start pistoning 
hard, back and forth, forcing more incredible moans out of her as she 
collapses forward, just managing to hold herself up on her hands and 
knees.  John grunts loudly under her, and his thrusts from under her 
start getting even more frantic.</p>
<p>In the end, you’re not sure who popped first…you, John, Roxy…hell, 
maybe you three pulled the ultimate porn move and managed to make it to 
the finish at the same time.  All you know is that, at some point, the 
pleasure overwhelmed you, and you slammed yourself in for one final, 
powerful thrust as you unload yourself into Roxy.  And then, once more, 
everything went white for a second.</p>
<p>………</p>
<p>Feels like your head’s recovering a little quicker than your first time.  Nice.</p>
<p>Still, the next thing you can comprehend is that you’re looking up at
 the ceiling, panting heavily as you lay on the mattress.  Guess 
post-orgasm-autopilot you was smart enough to flop onto the bed instead 
of collapsing on top of your partners like last time.  The heavy breaths
 coming from nearby alert you to John and Roxy’s position, as she’s 
still on top of Egbert at the moment, her head buried in his chest as 
she tries to catch her breath.</p>
<p>“Haah…haaah…Guuuh…” John lets out a groan as he pats Roxy on the 
back.  “Nuh…not that…I’m not a fan of cuddles, but…it’s kinda hard to 
breath…at the moment, Roxy…”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, yeah…bluh…”  Roxy grumbles back in response, but it takes a 
moment before she’s able to roll off of John and lay on the bed next to 
him.  “May…maybe you should…go a little easier…having a…hard time 
breathing…myself, John…”</p>
<p>“A-and who…was the one…going, “give it to me” …a second ago?”  John 
rolls over onto his side and pokes Roxy in her stomach, getting a giggle
 out of her.</p>
<p>“Heeheh…alright, c’mere you…”  Roxy rolls over and tries to tickle 
John lightly in mock retaliation, but both of them are too tired to do 
much.  Eventually John just hugs Roxy, and they share a cute kiss.  It’s
 pretty adorbs.</p>
<p>Yeah.  You’d add more, but you’re kinda spent at the moment.  And 
this pillow you’ve found your head on is pretty welcoming.  You wave 
your hand in Roxy and John’s direction, as they’ve moved onto simple 
cuddling by now, and mumble, “Hey…that was fucking great…but I’m kinda 
spent…gonna tap out here…if that’s alright.”</p>
<p>“Heh…yeah, I hear ya.”  Roxy lifts her hand and shoots you a thumbs 
up.  “Think we’ve all earned a little rest.  That was…yeah, ‘fucking 
great’ about sums it up, Davey…looking forward to next time.”</p>
<p>You’d like to do a little fist pump or something to celebrate landing
 the fabled ‘next time’ statement, but the fact is you’re already on 
your way to Lala Land.  All you do is lay your head back and mumble, 
“Cool…me too…”, and as soon as the words are out of your mouth, you’re 
already drifting off to sleep.</p>

<span class="john">JOHN: you’re…uh…you’re okay with everything, right?</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: we haven’t really talked much since, so…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: dont worry about it were cool</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i mean sure its a little weird talking about it but nothing we cant deal with</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: considering the shit weve had to deal with and all this is nothing</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: good!</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: that’s…whew.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i won’t lie, i was a little nervous that you were avoiding me.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: nah dont worry john</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: nothing weird between us or anything like that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i mean sure ive got a good picture of the egbert cannon in my head now but</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: oh god please don’t call it that.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: alright well workshop a better name later</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: we’re not going to do that.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: point is no things wont be weird just because ive seen your dick</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: assuming of course you dont feel weird seeing lil stride</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: nope, no problems there.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: well, aside from you telling me just now that you call it “lil’ stride”.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: not sure i can handle that knowledge.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shit</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: right forget i mentioned that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: in fact lets make a bro pact right now to expunge all past present and future talk of our junk from this conversation</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i’ll bunp to that.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: bunp secured pact now in place</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: this is now a junk free discussion</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: now over to john with sports john lay down how the big man took it to the hole</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: well, dave, the big man…uh, he sure dribbled the ball…uh, up to the hole, and…</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: yeah, who am i kidding, i know nothing about sports.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: should i have made it business news</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: you could break down those stock portfolios</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: go to town on that serious business shit</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: nah, serious business stuff was my dad’s wheelhouse.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: and jane’s i guess.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i’m just as bad at it as you.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: well then shit this is the worst newscast ive ever heard of</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: no sports or business all thats left is the weather then</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: thats all newscasts are right just business sports and weather</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: pretty much, as far as i remember.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: hang on, though, i can do weather.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: ahem…well dave, a look out the window says it’s mostly sunny today.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: high of warm and low of kinda cool, i guess.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: and im forecasting rain at some point, maybe, so prepare for that.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shit yes newscast secured</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: some ratings guys just ran in and yelled that we won all the ratings forever</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: alright, yeah!</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: take that, channel five, cause we’re the best in town.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: heh</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: were just trying to dance around things arent we</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: eh…kind of.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: still, just goofing off like that’s important every now and then.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: if we don’t, we tend to end up wallowing in a pool of weird immortal teen angst.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: guess youre right</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: good thing rose isnt here or shed give you one of those leader lines you hate</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: bluh, yeah, let’s try to avoid any of that, please.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: sure thing</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: also i dont want you thinking i was avoiding you because that’s not the case</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: you sure?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: hundred percent</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: day after took some adjustment to what went down but that was all</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: dirk came over and we hashed it out</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and afterwards i was back to cool kid status as always</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: that’s good…er…</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: dirk…uh, knows, then?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah pretty much</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i mean im sure roxy would have told him eventually even if he hadnt</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: hadn’t what?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: im gonna have ask you to pretend you didnt hear that</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: what!</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: sorry man total strider confidence law is in effect</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: not fit for non strider ears</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: oh come on!</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: you strilondes and your secrecy and rules, i swear.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah were awesome like that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: anyway</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i actually wanted to swing by after that but as i was about to leave</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: literally that exact second</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: rose stopped by</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and i had to endure her eyebrow wiggling routine for the rest of the day</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: oh boy.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: yeah, i can even see how that would be happening.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: you know how it goes</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shes all so i hear you had an entertaining evening at johns</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: a little birdie told me</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: one who absolutely isnt our teen mom who you totally had sex with</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: at this point she just goes into a fucking lecture about freud so ill spare you</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: thanks for that, i’ve had enough of those myself.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: yeah but at least for you its pillow talk so its not all bad</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: hey!</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: am i wrong</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: ……no…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: then yeah my point still stands</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: anyway after that bullshit happened she told me that the mayor had asked her to do some errands for him</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: she asked if i wouldnt mind helping</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and i was like fuck yes ill help the mayor hes the best</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: took longer than i thought but that’s why ive been out of touch</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: no avoidance intended</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: ok…well, like i said, i’m glad that’s all it was.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: my only fear with all this…uh, experimenting, i guess…is that i’ll end up seriously weirding someone out.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: last thing i want is to mess up a friendship just for one good night.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: roxy always says it’ll work out, but…you just never know, y’know?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i hear ya</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: though at the same time i can see where roxys confidence comes from</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i mean i never thought i could get into something like that yet lo and behold</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: once we were there i didnt have much trouble with it did i</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: uh…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: shit i steered it back to dong thoughts didnt i</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: forget i said that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: but anyway the point i was trying to make was i think you guysll be ok</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and not just because youre running out of people to invite into your bed anyway</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: but i got to see firsthand how much you guys make sure the person youre inviting is cool with it before you get into stuff</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: well i guess outside of that story you were 
telling me about jane but ill chalk it up to you guys still getting into
 the swing of things</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: oh god, that time…yeah.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: that was the most nervous i’ve ever been about messing things up with these threesomes.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i didn’t see her for more than a week after that.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: whoa really</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: yeah, i was really worried that she hated me.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: roxy was telling me to calm down but what did i know?</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i thought i might have really messed up our friendship</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: then jane finally came over to see me while roxy was out and…</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: uh…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: go on</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: she…did not hate me.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: you guys banged again huh</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: …yeah.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: you really dont have to beat around the bush anymore with me john</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: for better or worse im in this with you now</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: in fact why dont we air all that laundry right now</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: give me the weekly egbert fuck report</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: oh god, no…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: come on man</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: honestly you know im probably gonna hear about it from rox later</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: might as well tell me yourself so we can have a good laugh about it</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: uuuuugh…</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: fine, but later, please?</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: i’d rather not have all our conversations in the future revolve around my sex life, ok?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: eh i can live with that</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i can hold off on my choice ripping for a while at least</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: heh…guess i’ll have to prepare myself for that, huh?</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: anyway, what did you need to come over here for?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: what</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: what do you mean</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: roxy told me someone was coming over to help her out with something.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: she was being cagey about it, so i thought it might be another…situation…like last week.</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: but you’re here, so i guess…</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: john</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: i havent talked to roxy in a couple days</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: and i just came by to make sure we were cool</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: …so she wasn’t talking about you, then?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: no she was not</span><br>
<span class="black">*SLAM*</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: ALRIGHT, LALONDE, WHAT THE SHIT DO YOU WANT?</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: wha…karkat?</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: oh my sweet fuck no</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: OH GOOD, JOHN’S TAKING FIVE MINUTES OUT OF HIS BUSY SCHEDULE OF PAILING EVERY GIRL IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE.</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: AND DAVE’S WITH YOU AS WELL?  FUCKING INCREDIBLE.</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: MAYBE ONE OF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN ME AS TO 
WHY THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF HEDONISM JOHN CALLS A MATESPRIT NEEDS ME, 
OF ALL PEOPLE, TO HELP HER WITH, AND I QUOTE, “some important biz”.</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: SEEING AS THE TWO OF YOU ARE JUST SITTING 
HERE GAWKING LIKE FUCKING IMBECILES, I’D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR A REASON AS
 TO WHY YOU COULDN’T DEAL WITH WHATEVER VAGUE BULLSHIT LALONDE NEEDS 
DONE, AND WHY I HAD TO TAKE THE TIME OUT OF MY DAY TO COME OVER HERE.</span><br>
<span class="dave">DAVE: uh</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: ………</span><br>
<span class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT.</span><br>
<span class="roxy">ROXY: heeeeeey guys</span><br>
<span class="john">JOHN: NOPE  </span>
  <span class="dave">DAVE: NOPE</span><br>
<span class="roxy">ROXY: ………*wonk*</span>
